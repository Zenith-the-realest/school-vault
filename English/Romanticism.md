# Romanticism

Romanticism was a movement inspired by **The Enlightenment, specifically its poetry**.

# What was Enlightenment poetry?

Enlightenment poetry, which was between **1650s and the 1780s**, was a movement that took from *scientific developments and rationalism* instead of *religion*. The French Revolution was also inspired by this, due to its overthrow of the monarchy and strive for political freedom. Originally, **Wordsworth** (author of "The Prelude") supported this revolution, but it eventually devolved into bloodshed, proving his belief that humanity is evil.

This bloodshed made writing critical poetry unpopular, and a shift was needed to move away from this, found in **Romanticism**, which focused on the **power of imagination.** 

Romanticism can be defined using several conventions:

1. A dislike of urban life
2. A love of the supernatural
3. Use of ordinary, everyday language.

>An example of a *Romantic poem* is **The Prelude** by Wordsworth.
