# The Prelude - Poem

# Form:

## Epic Poetry:

The poem is in the form of a **epic poem**. An epic poem usually tells a story about heroic actions (usually historic or legendary), based on a hero.

> *Examples include "Paradise Lost", a poem by John Milton that tells the story of Adam & Eve.* 

In epic poetry, there is one major event; in The Prelude, it is an entire **lifetime** of events, and the poem is seen as his **growth as a poet**. However, the events that occur in this play do not fit the idea of being "epic": however, when thought of as Wordsworth's awakening to nature's power, it is much more clear.

> *However, in epic poetry, there is always a **hero**, which would be the poet at first glance, but it is also arguable that **nature** itself is the hero of the poem.* 

## The use of blank verse:

Blank verse is when the poem has **no rhyme scheme**, but is written in **iambic pentameter**. This was popularised by the aforementioned Milton's Paradise Lost, and it became commonplace for poets of the time to use it - including Wordsworth.

# Structure:

The poem is **one long, sprawling verse**, for several reasons: For example, the reader having to read the sprawling verses has them **overwhelmed** by the intensity of the poem; similar to how Wordsworth as a young boy was overwhelmed by what he saw on the boat.

This use of a singular verse also creates a **conversational tone**, as if Wordsworth is trying to inform the reader of his revelatory experiences with nature. 


# Language:

In the poem, the speaker (Wordsworth as a boy), is convinced to steal the boat by a "her"; this "her" is **nature** itself. The feminine gender found in nature (along with other words like "boat", "cave", and "lake")contrasts the masculine words like "oars","line","ridge", and "peak". It is clear that the poet was not intending to steal a boat on his venture, but was **taken there by nature**.

>*One summer evening (led by her) I found*
>*A little boat tied to a willow tree* 

The enjambment of this sentence adds to how overwhelmed Wordsworth as a child was overwhelmed by nature.

>*Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in* 
>*Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth* 
>*And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice* 
>*Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;*

The boy unchaining the boat is described as an *act of stealth*. "Stealth" has a connotation of being sneaky and sly; the action is morally wrong, but the poet doesn't care. This means the first presentation of "man" is as selfish, as the boy takes a boat without forethought of the consequence. This pride is further exaggerated, as the child is said to be rowing whilst "*proud of his skill.* "

>*Leaving behind her still, on either side,*
>*Small circles glittering idly in the moon*,
>*Until they melted all into one track*
>*Of sparkling light.*

The poet describes the boat on the water - the imagery is *positive*, describing it as **"circles glittering"** and **"sparkling light"**  gives the water a magical, almost celestial quality. This positivity is **contrasted** in later lines. The present participles such as "stepping" and "leaving" build up to the most *positive point* of the poem, showing that there will later be a decline.

>But now, like one who rows,
Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point
With an unswerving line, I fixed my view
Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,
The horizonâ€™s utmost boundary; far above
Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.

Here the pride of man is again mentioned, but the simile *"like one who rows, proud of his skill"* shows that he is uncertain, but the use of *chosen* shows the poet's arrogance; he is nn control, heading towards the point he has chosen to. 
## The poet's arrogance:

The poet uses personification throughout the poem, but there is a visible lack of it being used to **to describe the mountain,** it is now labelled an "it". The previous moments had the poet hold power, and was able to define them as he chose, but loses that power in the cliff face.

> This is even more apparent in the vocabulary used to describe the mountain: a "huge peak". The ambitious vocabulary has left the poet, as he is unable to express himself in the face of the peak.

> *I struck and struck again,*
*And growing still in stature the grim shape*
*Towered up between me and the stars, and still,*
*For so it seemed, with purpose of its own*
*And measured motion like a living thing,*
*Strode after me*

The poet **starts to lose his grip on reality here,**  stating the mountain had a ,**"purpose of its own"**  and that it **"strode after him".**  However, he says "so it seemed", meaning that he no longer believes what he thought happened; the mountain did NOT follow him. 

>*With trembling oars I turned,*
>*And through the silent water stole my way*
>*Back to the covert of the willow tree;*

The poet is scared now, and retreats to shore - The word "stole" is used here, in reference to "stealth", but now the **the arrogance of the poet has dissappeared**, showing how man is powerless in the face of nature. 

>*There in her mooring-place I left my bark -* 
*And through the meadows homeward went, in grave* 
*And serious mood* 

Here, the **poet leaves the boat where he found it, and goes home in a serious and unhappy mood**. The use of "grave and serious" is unspecific compared to the other emotions in the poem. This vague language reflects how major the sight the poet saw was; he could not articulate it.

>*but after I had seen* 
*That spectacle, for many days, my brain* 
*Worked with a dim and undetermined sense* 
*Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts*
*There hung a darkness, call it solitude* 
*Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes* 
*Remained, no pleasant images of trees,* 
*Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields ;* 
*But huge and mighty forms, that do not live* 
*Like living men, moved slowly through the mind* 
*By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.* 

The ending is the most problematic part; the poet is unable to shake the *"darkness"* of his thoughts, as everything he knew (the *"familiar shapes"*) are now gone.

The vague language appears once again in the *dim and undetermined sense of unknown*, showing how the poet is both able and unable to describe **his shock**. This idea is again conveyed in "**Darkness, call it solitude**".

The repetition of "no" in "**No familiar shapes / Remained, no pleasant images of trees,/ Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields** " has the theme of the poem highlighted; he now knows the vast expanse of which he does not know. This is evident through the fact that his pride has now vanished; **he can only explain through what he DOESN'T know.** 

## The change of the poet:

The poet now has to reevaluate everything that he knows, due to the sheer magnitude of what he has seen - he even struggles to sleep at night, realising his thoughts were limited.

Wordsworth's views of "Man, Nature and Society" are clear; Man/society are condemned in this poem as **prideful and arrogant**, seen through the depiction of the poet in the first half. Nature is depicted as **powerful, but also terrifying**, evident in the second half, where the boy shakenly returns with the boat. It is clear that **humans don't have control over nature; nature has control over them.**
