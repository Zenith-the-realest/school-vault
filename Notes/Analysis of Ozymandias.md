# Analysis of Ozymandias

## Perspective:

The poem is written from the *first person perspective*, but the speaker is never revealed / identified. He is an **omniscient** speaker.
 - The pronoun “I” is only used once, showing that the perspective doesn’t actually matter.
## Opening:
The poem begins with “**I met a traveller** from an antique land”, showing that the perspective is detached from Shelley himself, in an attempt to remove himself from the political message of the poem.

## Structure:

Ozymandias’s **irregular rhyme scheme** contrasts with its single stanza, as the former suggests **the lack of power / control of the ruler,** whereas the single stanza suggests order. The contrasts could reflect how groups of people view conflict to be *beneficial or detrimental*.

The poem uses a sonnet in conjunction with the irregular rhyme scheme, showing the trademark of the era – the Romantic poets would blend both past and present traditions to protest the future.

## Language:

Shelley uses alliteration to show the vast power of the desert, while also belittling the power of man.
- The statue can be interpreted as a **representation of human power – a king’s attempt to evade death and be cemented in history.**
