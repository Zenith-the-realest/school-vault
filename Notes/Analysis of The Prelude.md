# Analysis of The Prelude

## Perspective:

Because the poem as a whole is **autobiographical**, the speaker can be assumed to be a fictionalised version of Wordsworth – the peom therefore reveals many personal details about him.
	This idea is emphasised by the **first person narration** and use of *past tense*, showing the speaker recalls events that are clear and personally experienced.

However, the writer also blurs past and present together – he also uses “leaving”, “glittering”, and “sparkling”, for e.g. This shows how the events have shaped how he lives and views the world.

## Structure:

The Prelude was written as an **epic poem** – a lengthy, narrative poem that focus on a **heroic protagonist** and events they are involved in. Because the poem is autobiographical, the “hero” is Wordsworth himself, but it can be argued that the hero wouldn’t be Wordsworth, but rather the **personification of nature**.

It is possible that Wordsworth intended the adventure not to be physical, but rather focused on his **spiritual growth**, and journey of becoming a poet, including his realisation of nature’s power and his own insignificance.

The entire poem is a **single stanza**, emphasising the *overwhelming power* of nature. The lack of breaks and pauses makes the reader feel **breathless**, also emphasising this idea.
