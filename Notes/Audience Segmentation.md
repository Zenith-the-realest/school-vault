# Audience Segmentation

Usually, most media products have a defined *target audience*. The way this is deduced is known as **segmentation**; the process of grouping people via key characteristics.

| **Category** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Age          | How old the target audience is (usually an age range is used {e.g 13-17}). This affects the design due to appropriateness of certain aspects being included.    |
| Gender       | Whether the target audience is male or female – a feminine product would use more feminine colours.                                                             |
| Occupation   | The job someone does – their job may affect the design / content.                                                                                               |
| Income       | Income can influence the style and design – a luxury brand would probably use more rich colours, like gold.                                                     |
| Education    | What level of education the target audience is educated at – influences content used in the product.                                                            |
| Location     | Where the target audience lives. A media company producing **television** for example, would produce something relevant to that area's location.                |
| Interests    | The interests and hobbies of the target audience – influences the design and content of the media product – a sports website would have lots of sports, per se. |
| Lifestyle    | Active and relaxed are examples of lifestyle – a cruise advertisement / poster will target those of a more relaxed lifestyle.                                   |             |                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Why is it used?

Audience segmentation is used to:

- Ensure the content and design of a final product are **suitable and appropriate** for the intended audience – if not, it may not meet its **purpose.**
- Help designers and developers make **key decisions** throughout the development of a media product – having an audience helps focus **decision making.**
