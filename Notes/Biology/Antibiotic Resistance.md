# Antibiotic Resistance

# What are antibiotics?

Antibiotics are **drugs that can kill bacteria,** the first and most famous being **penicillin.** Originally, it could kill **lots of bacteria,** but its repeated and **frequent use** have helped bacteria become **resistant.** 

# How does resistance occur?

Imagine you had a colony of bacteria inside you, that were causing **sore throats and headaches.** The doctor **prescribes you antibiotics,** which are supposed to **come into contact with bacteria and *kill it.*** 

However, like all other organisms, bacteria can have **mutations occur in their DNA,** which can cause **changes in characteristics.** Very occasionally, these changes can cause the bacteria to become **less affected / more resistant to the antibiotic.** 

Although it kills **most of the bacteria,** the ones that have mutated to become more resistant **survive.** Because bacteria reproduce so quickly, and there is no **competition,** it forms a **new colony of its own,** which have this **antibiotic resistant gene.** 

> This new colony formed is known as an **antibiotic resistant strain.** 

Due to the antibiotics no longer working, you remain ill, meaning you can **spread it to other people.** These people will also go to the doctor, and get prescribed the **same antibiotic,** which will still fail to work. This means they will have to return, and get a **new antibiotic,** and that one will usually work.
    - However, the bacteria can still reproduce and mutate to become more resistant to this one, and the cyle can continously repeat, meaning that it has become **resistant to *two* types of antibiotics.** 

> Bacteria that has become resistant to multiple antibiotics are known as **superbugs,** an example being ***MRSA, which is resistant to lots of antibiotics.*** This resistance means that it can be very common, and also **fatal.** 

Despite this, antibiotic resistant bacteria are still very **uncommon,** and even then, it is not usually **entirely resistant**. This means that if you take the antibiotic for the **full course,** you may very well still be able to kill it.

## What are problems with antibiotic resistance?

The problem with antibiotic resistant is that due to the fact that there are **so many antibiotics,** resistance is **bound to occur.** One of the reasons so many are used, is because **doctors use antibiotics when they won't work, such as viral infections.** Additionally, doctors also use them in **non-serious cases, like stomach bugs,** which usually clear themselves in a few days.

Another big problem is **farmers,** who give them in the food of already **healthy animals,** to prevent illness and to ***grow faster.*** This means that it is practically a **breeding ground** for antibiotic resistance.
