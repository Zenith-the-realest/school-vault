# Biotic and Abiotic factors

# What types of factors affect an ecosystem?

There are two types of factors affecting an ecosystem:

- Biotic factors: the living ones. For example, in a woodland ecosystem, the **presence of trees, squirrels and hedgehogs** count as ***biotic factors.*** Numbers of organisms also count as biotic factors.
- Abiotic factors: non-living / physical factors. For example, once again in a woodland ecosystem, abiotic factors could include **rainfall received,** or the **temperature of the ecosystem.** 

> Many organisms **compete** for factors, like *food, space and breeding partners.* This means that competition is the **most common *biotic* factor.** 

## How do **abiotic factors** affect communities?

### Light intensity:

Light intensity is required for photosynthesis, and therefore the survival of the producers. The higher the light availability, the greater the survivability of the plant is.

However, even in areas of low light, plants can **evolve** to *adapt to the low light.* For example, in low light areas, plants will have **larger leaves.** 

### Temperature:

Temperature has the greatest effect on the control of **metabolic reactions.** Plants will develop more rapidly in warmer temperatures, as their **metabolism** will be faster. This also counts for *cold-blooded animals, like lizards,* which rely on the **Sun** to warm them up.

However, warm-blooded animals are less affected by this.

### Moisture level:

For most plants and animals, lack of water leads to death - for example, water is what mainly makes up blood plasma. A lack of water will cause **plants to wilt,** as water is needed for **cell turgidity,** which keeps them upright. Water is also required for **photosynthesis.** 

### Soil pH:

Soil pH affects biological activity in soil, and the availability of certain minerals the plant might need. Some plants grow better in acidic soil (ph < 7), and some grow better in alkaline soil (ph > 7).
