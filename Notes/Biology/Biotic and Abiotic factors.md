# Biotic and Abiotic factors

# What types of factors affect an ecosystem?

There are two types of factors affecting an ecosystem:

- Biotic factors: the living ones. For example, in a woodland ecosystem, the **presence of trees, squirrels and hedgehogs** count as ***biotic factors.*** Numbers of organisms also count as biotic factors?
- Abiotic factors: non-living / physical factors. For example, once again in a woodland ecosystem, abiotic factors could include **rainfall received,** or the **temperature of the ecosystem.**
