# Communicable Diseases 1 - Intro

# What are microorganisms?

Microorganisms are tiny organisms including **bacteria, viruses, protists and fungi.** Individually, they don't cause problems, but the ones that do are called **pathogens.** 
> The definition of pathogens are **"microorganisms that can cause disease."** 

# What are the diseases do pathogens spread?

The diseases that pathogens can spread are called **communicable diseases.** 

## How do pathogens spread it?

### Air:

An example of a communicable disease is **influenza, or measles, which are viruses.** Theses diseases are spread via the air, such as **coughs or sneezes.** 

### Contamination:

Another example is **cholera,** which is **bacterial,** spread via drinking **contaminated water**.

Another example is **salmonella,** is spread via eating **contaminated food:** 

### Direct contact:

Athlete's foot, which causes flaking of skin on the feet, is spread via **barefoot walking,** where the fungi can spread.

## How do we avoid the spread of diseases?

- Staying hygienic, i.e washing hands after bathroom, or before cooking
- Kill vectors of pathogens (what transports them), like a mosquito, which transfers the **malaria protist.** For insects, you can use **insecticides.** 

However, the best way is to **vaccinate someone,** which makes them immune.

### What if someone catches it anyway?

If it is a very serious disease, the person can be **isolated or quarantined.**
