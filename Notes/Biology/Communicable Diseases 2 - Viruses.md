# Communicable Diseases 2 - Viruses

# What are viruses?

Viruses are not living, nor are they cells, but they are **still considered organisms.** They **cannot reproduce themselves,** but if they get inside another organism's cell, they use that cell to make copies of themselves, and the cell eventually bursts, and these new copies look for other cells. This damages our bodies, and **makes us feel ill.** 
# Measles:

Measles is spread when an infected person **coughs or sneezes,** and can cause a **red rash across the body, or a fever.** It can even ***be fatal.*** 

# HIV:

HIV can be spread by **sexual contact** (unprotected sex), or **exchanging bodily fluids,** which is usually done by ***sharing needles.*** HIV stands for "**Human Immunodeficiency Virus**", which causes the immune system to become **deficient / inadequate to protect yourself from disease.** The term HIV is used to refer to the **virus,** and not the disease. In the beginning, there can be **fever, tiredness and aches,** but then will feel better.

However, they are not becoming better, but rather the virus is doing more damage to their immune system, eventually becoming so **weak,** that they catch **unusual infections, and some cases in cancer.** This is called "**AIDS**", which stands for **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.**

> Originally, this used to be the final stage, but after the introduction of **antiretroviral drugs,** which stop the **virus replicaating,** if someone uses these drugs early in their disease, they can **live normally.** 

# Tobacco mosaic virus:

This virus only affects **plants,** such as **tobacco and tomato plants, and spreads via contact as opposed to insects** This **discolours patches of the leaves,** which is tobacco-coloured, hence **tobacco** mosaic disease. However, this discolouring is not just cosmetic: this **prevents photosynthesis on the discoloured areas,** meaning the plant won't be able to produce **sugars for growth.**
