# Communicable Diseases 3 - Bacteria

When people think about bacteria, they think of disease, but usually, **bacteria don't have a lot to do with humans.** In fact, a lot of them **help us,** such as the trillions of bacteria in your intestine, that help break down food. However, there are still disease-causing bacteria.

# What are bacteria?

Bacteria are single celled organisms, which are **100x smaller than our cells.** Although they can reproduce on their own, but they can reproduce rapidly in **our bodies, due to the *high food supply.*** However, they can also **produce toxins,** which damage our cells and tissues, and make us feel ill.

# Salmonella:

An example is salmonella bacteria, which causes food poisoning. This can be caught via eating **any food contaminated with it, which is *more often than not chicken, which had caught it when they were alive.*** This is not usually the case, as chicken are usually **vaccinated against this.** 

Salmonella can cause **stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea.** This makes sense, as it affects the ***small intestine,*** which will give you stomach problems. Salmonella usually passes **within a week,** as long as the person is **well hydrated.** 

# Tuberculosis (TB):

Tuberculosis is spread by the *Myobacterium tuberculosis* bacterium. It is transmitted via **airborne contact, such as droplets released when infected people cough.** 

Symptoms include **cough, weight loss, fevers, fatigue and lung damage.**

## Treatment:

Treatment can be done with **long-term antibiotics.** 

## Prevention:

Take the **TB vaccine (BCG)**, good **ventilation and hygiene,** and **isolating infected patients.** 
# Gonorrhea:

Gonorrhea is another example, but it is an STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease). It is passed on via **sexual contact**, such as **unprotected sex.** 

It can cause **pain when urinating,** or **thick yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis.** 


# How is gonorrhea prevented or treated?

## Prevention:

- Avoid **unsafe sex**
- Barrier methods of **contraception (condoms)**

## Treatment:

- Typically use the **antibiotic penicillin.** However, many strains of gonorrhea have become **resistant to penicillin,** meaning **rarer and more expensive antibiotics** have to be used.
