# Communicable Diseases 4 - Protists and Fungi

# What are fungi? 

Fungi are **eukaryotic organisms** like animals and plants. However, fungi can be
**unicellular (yeast) or multicellular (mushrooms)**. Multicellular ones usually have **hyphae,** which come out of the main body and ***spread through the soil.*** However, they can occasionally **spread over plants or *penetrate human skin and cause disease.*** 
However, the hyphae can also **produce spores,** which spread easily and **grow into new fungi.** 

## Rose black spot:

**Rose black spot** is an example of a **fungal disease.** This causes *purple or black spots* to form on plants, especially **roses, hence "rose black spot".** As the fungus does more damage, the leaves can **start to turn yellow and drop off,** which decreases the **plant's ability to photosynthesise, stunting growth.** 

It normally spreads via the **water or the wind.** To treat it, the **infected leaves can be chopped off, or spray it with fungicide.** 

> If you chop off the leaves, you **must destroy them,** to prevent the spread of the fungi.

# What are protists?

Protists are also **eukaryotic,** and can also be **multi or unicellular.** However, most protists are **unicellular,** and some are classed as **parasites,** meaning they survive at the **other organism's expense.** 

Protists are usually spread by **vectors,** which are **other organisms like insects, that transport the protists between organisms.** However, the vectors do **not get the disease.** 

## Malaria:

Malaria is an example of a **parasitic protist,** meaning it needs a **host to survive.** It is transported between hosts by **mosquitoes.** When a mosquito feeds on an **infected animal, sucking out the blood,** it can suck up the *malaria parasite.* When another healthy animal, like a person, comes along, and the mosquito feeds on them, the **malaria parasite gets transferred, which has spread them to another organism.**

Symptoms of malaria include **fever and headaches,** which go away and come back repeatedly, called **recurrent episodes.** In dire cases, it can even be ***fatal.*** 

### Prevention:

- Stop vectors spreading the protists, which is essentially **killing the mosquitoes.** This can be done by:
1. Killing them with insecticides
2. Destroying their breeding sites.

We can also stop them feeding on us, via using **mosquito nets** or **repellent.**
