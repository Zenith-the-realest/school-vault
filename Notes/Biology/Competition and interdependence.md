# Competition and interdependence

## What is competition?

Competition is what results from different animals requiring the same materials from their surroundings. If these are limited, animals will **compete for these resources.** 

- This often leads to weaker competitors **dying or leaving that area.** Because plants can't leave, they often die.

### What is needed for survival?

#### Plants:

- Light
- Water
- Carbon dioxide
- Minerals
- Space

#### Animals:

- Food
- Water
- Breeding partners
- Space (territory)
- Shelter


The number of organisms of each species in an area is called a **population:** competition has a direct effect on population size. As an example, if there is lots of food, the population is likely to increase.

# How do species interact within a community?

The way organisms depend on each other is known as **interdependence:** the interactions between the organisms are known as **ecological relationships.** There are three main types: **predation, mutualism and parasitism.** 

- Predation: this is the name given to the relationship between **predator and prey.** The size of the predator population directly affects prey population.

- Mutualism: In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms benefit from the relationship. For example, **oxpeckers** are small birds that live on buffalo, known as *cleaner species,* as they **eat ticks and fleas living on it.** The oxpeckers gain food, and the buffalo is freed from irritation and disease.

- Parasitism: In a parasitic relationship, one organism benefits. The parasite benefits, while the organism it lives off (the host) suffers. Examples include tapeworms in an animal's digestive system, and fleas.
