# Competition and interdependence

## What is competition?

Competition is what results from different animals requiring the same materials from their surroundings. If these are limited, animals will **compete for these resources.** 

- This often leads to weaker competitors **dying or leaving that area.** Because plants can't leave, they often die.

### What is needed for survival?

#### Plants:

- Light
- Water
- Carbon dioxide
- Minerals
- Space

#### Animals:

- Food
- Water
- Breeding partners
- Space (territory)
- Shelter

## How population is affected:

The number of organisms of each species in an area is called a **population:** competition has a direct effect on poppulation size. As an example, if there is lots of food, the population is likely to increase.

# How do species interact within a community?

The way organisms depend on each other is known as **interdependence:** the interactions between the organisms are known as **ecological relationships.** There are three main types: **predation, mutualism and parasitism.** 

- Predation: this is the name given to the relationship between **predator and prey.**
