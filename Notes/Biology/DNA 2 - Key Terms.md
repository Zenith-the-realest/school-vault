# DNA 2 - Key Terms

A gene is a **segment of DNA** that codes for a specific protein. The genes we inherit determine our characteristics. Some characteristics are coded by a specific gene, e.g **eye colour,** but others are determined by **several genes,** like **height.** 

Because genes code for **particular types of proteins,** there are ***multiple forms of one protein***. These are **called alleles,** which are different forms of the same gene.

# How do alleles work?

We inherit **two alleles** from our **two parents.** These alleles can be **the same (homozygous) or different (heterozygous)**. 

## How can we determine which allele is **expressed?** 

One of the alleles can be **dominant,** and one can be **recessive.** The **dominant allele** is ***always expressed whenever it is present,*** no matter if there's one or two. This means that in order for the recessive allele to be expressed, **both the alleles must be recessive.** Usually, the dominant is presented with a capital letter (D for e.g) and recessive with lowercase (d, for e.g). So for a recessive allele to be expressed, it must be "dd", but for a dominant, it can be "Dd" or "DD".

> The terms homozygous can be either **homozygous dominant, or homozygous recessive, depending on which it is.** 

# What are genotypes and phenotypes?

## Genotypes:

The more common definition for this course is **the two alleles present for a particular gene,** but in general it is **the individuals collection of genes.** 

## Phenotype:

Phenotype is the **characteristic** expressed as a result of your **genotype -** a dominant allele will always be the **expressed phenotype.**
