# Decomposition

## What does decomposition do?

Decomposition is done by microorganisms to **help recycle materials.** An example is **nitrogen,** which is decomposed from proteins (animals & plants) and urea (animals) into ammonia, becoming ammonium ions and then nitrates by **nitrogen-fixing bacteria.** It becomes nitrates due to the decomposition of the proteins and urea, which is one example of the vitality of decomposers to an ecosystem.

## What are the main types of decomposers?

The main types of decomposers are microorganisms, such as **bacteria and fungi.** The role of decomposers is to break down dead organisms and waste products to be reused.

# What are the factors that affect rate of decomposition?

1. Oxygen availability
    - Many decomposers require oxygen for **aerobic respiration,** so rate of decomposition increases when lots of oxygen is available. Conversely, the rate of decomposition decreases when there is less oxygen. Even if decomposers can **anaerobically respire,** it still produces less energy, so these work slower.
2. Temperature
    - Most decomposers work best in **warm conditions** - the rate of decomposition is best at approx. 50Â°C. This is because decomposers contain **enzymes that *digest* the dead / waste material.** The rate f enzyme-controlled reactions vary with temperature - higher temperature means faster, but above a certain point, it **denatures,** so the reaction stops.
3. Water Content
    - Decomposers need **water for survival,** so moist conditions increase rate of decomposition. However, **waterlogged soils** don't have a lot of oxygen, so rate decreases if too much water.
