# Decomposition

## What does decomposition do?

Decomposition is done by microorganisms to **help recycle materials.** An example is **nitrogen,** which is decomposed from proteins (animals & plants) and urea (animals) into ammonia, becoming ammonium ions and then nitrates by **nitrogen-fixing bacteria.** It becomes nitrates due to the decomposition of the proteins and urea, which is one example of the vitality of decomposers to an ecosystem.

## What are the main types of decomposers?

The main types of decomposers are microorganisms, such as **bacteria and fungi.** The role of decomposers is to break down dead organisms and waste products to be reused.
