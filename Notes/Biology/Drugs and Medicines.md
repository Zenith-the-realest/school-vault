# Drugs and Medicines

# What groups can we split medicines into?

We can split them into two groups: medicine that **relieve the symptoms,** or something to **treat the disease.** 

### Example: sore throat:

Symptom relieving medicines: **Aspirin, Paracetamol, or cough medicine.** These are known as **painkillers.** 
Disease treating: Antibiotics, which **directly kill bacteria, and stop them growing.** 

> However, antibiotics only work on **bacteria,** but sore throats are usually caused by **viruses.** 

## Why can't antibiotics work on viruses?

Antibiotics are **specifically made for bacteria,** and because viruses are so different, it will have **no effect.** However, even if antibiotics could kill viruses (which they can't), they would be unable to find them, as viruses **hide within the body's cells.** 

## Why are there types of antibiotics?

There are different types of antibiotics, which are each made to kill ***certain types of bacteria.*** This means that doctors might need to run a test first to find the type of it.

> However, another issue is when bacteria become **antibiotic resistant,** which means that the antibiotics cannot be used, as the bacteria have grown **resistant.**

# What are **antibiotics, antivirals, and antiseptics, and what are their differences?** 

## Antibiotics:

Used to treat or prevent **bacterial infections.** Work by **killing the bacteria** or preventing their spread.

## Antivirals:

Used to treat **viral infections.** Do not **kill the virus, but rather prevent them from reproducing.** 

## Antiseptics:

Used to **sterilise surfaces** by **destroying any microorganism that live on it.** Used on items like **surgical equipment,** or when **washing a wound.**
