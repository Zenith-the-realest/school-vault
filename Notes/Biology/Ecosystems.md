# Ecosystems

## What are **ecosystems?** 

Ecosystems are made up of **all the living organisms and conditions in an area.** 
    - The organisms in the ecosystem are the **community,** 
    - and the area which they live in is their **habitat.** 

> For example, in a *pond,* the habitat is the pond itself, including the **stones, algae soil and water.** The community includes **frog, fish, insects and plants.** The total number of organisms is the *population.*

# What groups can organisms be organised into?


Organisms in a community can be divided into **three** distinct groups:

1. Producers - organisms that make their own food via **photosynthesis,** i.e plants and algae.
2. Consumers - organisms that **can't** make their own food, and eat **other organisms.** to gain energy. All animals are consumers.
3. Decomposers - a special group of consumers that gain energy by feeding on **dead or decaying materials.** 

## How do these organisms transfer energy?

For producers, the energy from the **Sun is transferred by light to the chlorophyll,** where *carbon dioxide and water* react to make glucose, storing energy within its chemical bonds.

Consumers then eat these producers, and when the organism respires, the energy from the food is transferred in its **production of ATP.** 

*(See [[Photosynthesis]] for more detail)* 

# What is a food **chain**?

Food chains displays what organisms eat. The arrows show **transfer of biomass (therefore energy)** from one organism to the next. An example of a food chain could be:

Grass → Rabbit → Fox

Here, the grass's biomass is transferred to the rabbit, and the rabbit's biomass is transferred to the fox.

## How are consumers classified within their food chains?

Consumers can be further split:

- The first consumer of the food chain is known as the **primary consumer.** These are usually herbivores that rely on eating producers.
- The second is a **secondary consumer,** and can be *carnivores -* animals that only eat other animals.
- Usually, it ends at the third consumer, known as the **tertiary consumer.** 

# What is a food **web?** 

A limitation of food chains is that it only shows **organisms eating *one* food source.** In most communities, animals will eat a variety of organisms - a sparrow might eat **slugs, snails AND worms.** Illustrating this is done by the use of a ***food web,*** which is simply a series of interlinked food chains.
