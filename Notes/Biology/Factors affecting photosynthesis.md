# Factors affecting photosynthesis

## What are factors that affect rate of photosynthesis called?

These factors are called **limiting factors.** These include *light intensity, carbon dioxide, and temperature.* 

### How can you measure the rate of photosynthesis?

There are two ways to do this that stem from the same idea: the **products of photosynthesis:** 

- Measuring how much **oxygen is made.** 
- Measuring the **increase in *biomass:* plants produce glucose as a product of photosynthesis, which are used to make its new cells.**

# Effect of limiting factors of photosynthesis:

## Light intensity:

The higher the light intensity, the **faster** the rate of photosynthesis, which continues until the **maximum rate of photosynthesis is reached.** 

## Carbon dioxide:

Carbon dioxide is one of the **reactants of photosynthesis:** this means the amount of it is a factor affecting photosynthesis. The **greater** the carbon dioxide concentration, the **faster the rate of reaction.** However, there is a very little amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (0.04%). This means that carbon dioxide is often the ***most limiting factor.*** 

> To circumvent this, farmers **artificially increase** the level of carbon dioxide in *greenhouses,* increasing rate of photosynthesis:

## Temperature:

Because photosynthesis is a series of **enzyme-controlled reactions,** the temperature is a factor that must be kept in mind when discussing the rate. It follows the same trend as regular enzyme-controlled reactions: As temperature increases up to a certain point, rate of photosynthesis increases until it has reached its **optimum temperature.** However, once it exceeds that point, the enzymes begin to **denature, and the reaction stops.**
