# Genetic Engineering

# What is the point of genetic engineering?

The basic idea is that we find an organism with a **desirable characteristic, e.g** a plant that has ***high yield.*** We then transfer the gene responsible for this to another organism, so the other organism **takes on this trait.** This modifies the organism's **genome**. This organism is now known as a **genetically modified (GM)** organism now.

> Genetic engineering is not limited to the **same species -** the genes can be transferred to other species.

# Examples of genetic engineering:

## Sheep:

Sheep have been genetically modified to produce **drugs in their milk,** which are extracted and used to treat diseases.

## Bacteria:

Bacteria have been genetically modified to produce **insulin,** which is then harvested to treat **diabetes.** 

## Crops:

Crops are the most prevalent in genetic engineering, and they have been genetically modified for:
1. Yield
2. Taste (size + quality)
3. Resistance to:
    1. Diseases 
    2. Insects
    3. Herbicides
    4. Droughts

# How have scientists been thinking about using genetic engineering in the future?

Scientists have been hoping to use it to **treat inherited disorders (which are due to faulty genes.)** However, this is very difficult, as the new gene would have to be transferred to **every cell that has it, which is very *hard.*** 

> A solution to this is to transfer the gene in an **early stage of development, e.g *egg or embryo.*** 

# Problems with genetic engineering:

There can be many issues with genetic engineering, as an example, we can look at the **pros and cons of GM crops.** 

## Pros:

- Crops can be made with desirable characteristics, like **more fruits, or resistance to disease (as mentioned before)** 
    - The former is especially useful, as we can make **more food for less money,** which is important in places like ***developing countries.*** 
- We can have plants produce **special nutrients,** like ***golden rice,*** which has **beta-carotene,** which prevents blindness.

## Cons:

- We cannot say with **100% certainty** about how genetically modified plants affect our health (although there is **no evidence that they are bad**)
- There is also the chance that these plants get into the wild, where they can **outcompete** other plants, and change the **ecosystem.** 
    - However, this is very unlikely, as these crops have been produced to survive in **fields.** 

# How is genetic engineering conducted?

Firstly, we use **restriction enzymes** to cut the desired section out to isolate it. This gives the gene **sticky ends.**  We then insert the gene into a vector, which can be a **virus, or bacterial plasmid (loops of DNA bacteria have.)** This is done using the same **restriction enzyme,** so the gene has **complementary sticky ends.**   We then introduce it to the organism we want to have the gene, which will take up the vector and the gene, and start **producing the protein the gene codes for.** 

## Specific: Insulin-producing bacteria.

1. Isolate insulin gene from human DNA using **restriction enzymes** 
2. Use the same restriction enzyme on the **bacterial plasmid,** which forms **complementary sticky ends** 
3. Insert insulin gene into plasmid using **DNA ligase,** which forms a **recombinant plasmid.**  
4. Insert **recombinant** plasmid into the host bacteria.
5. Let the bacteria **divide and produce** the insulin protein.
