# Immune System and Defenses

The defenses our body have can be split into two groups:

- Physical and chemical barriers: **stop pathogens getting in** 
- Immune system: **destroy pathogens in the body.** 

# Physical and chemical barriers:

## Skin:

Acts as a **physical barriers, preventing pathogens getting in.** The skin also secrets **antimicrobial substances,** which kill the pathogens.

## Nose:

Because the pathogens can't get through the skin, they may target the nose. However, the has **lots of little hairs that contain *mucus,*** which **trap the pathogen or other particles that flow through.** 

## Trachea + oesophagus:

If the pathogens still manage to get through the nose, they will have to either travel through the **trachea or oesophagus.**

- If they head for the lungs via trachea, the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles are **covered in a layer of mucus** that trap the pathogens. To avoid a buildup of this mucus, they are also lined with ***cilia,*** which are tiny protrusions from the cells, and as they move, they **slowly move the mucus and other trapped particles up to the back of the throat, where they travel through the stomach.** 

## Stomach:

In the stomach, **hydrochloric acid is produced,** which is very **strong,** and is so acidic (pH 2) that it kills almost **all pathogens.** 

# Immune System:

Although there are lots of physical and chemical defenses in the body, some pathogens will still through, and it is the job of the immune system to kill them.

## White Blood Cells:

Patrol the body, circulating in blood and tissues. They have 3 important functions:

- **Phagocytosis:** Certain white blood cells consume (engulf) the pathogen. Done by **tracking down the pathogen, binding to them, and finally engulfing them, where they can *destroy them.*** 
- **Producing antitoxins:** One of the main issues with pathogens are the fact that they produce harmful **proteins called *toxins,*** which are tiny poisons that damage our cells. In response, white blood cells produce **antitoxins,** which are small molecules that **bind and counteract the toxins, to stop them *doing damage.*** 
- Producing antibodies:

> Antigens are substances that our immune system detects as **foreign, like cell wall of bacteria or virus protein.** Antibodies are **small proteins made by our white blood cells,** that lock onto **the antigens,** signalling white blood cells to **destroy them.** 

> Antibodies are specific for a particular antigen, so if one antibody bonds to an antigen, it won't be able to bind to another. However, once our immune system **knows which of our antibodies bind to the pathogen,** it produces ***lots of them.*** It also ***remembers this,*** so if the pathogen attacks again, our body will produce **lots of antibodies so quickly, that it can destroy the pathogen before it can develop.** This is what is meant by ***immunity.***
