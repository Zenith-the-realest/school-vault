# Mutations

# What is a mutation?

A change in the **base sequence of DNA, like a C changing to a G.**

Mutations can happen **spontaneously in our cells,** when *DNA is replicated.* However, there are **certain factors that can *increase the risk.*** 

## What factors increase risk of mutation?

1. Carcinogens - harmful chemicals that can also be found in **cigarette smoke.** 
2. X-Ray and Gamma radiation - can ionise our DNA.

> However, these do not always ***cause mutation*** -  they simply **increase the risk.** 

# How do mutations affect our body?

Changing a base in our DNA means that the codon (triplet of bases) will code for a **different amino acid.** This means that the shape of the protein may change. This is serious for cases like enzymes, where an **incorrect shape** will change the **shape of the active site,** meaning it cannot ***form an enzyme-substrate complex,*** and make it unable to **catalyse** the reaction.

> However, most of the time, **mutations do not have significant effects on protein.** This is because their changes are often very **minor.** 
> Additionally, most mutations occur in **non-coding DNA, which does not code for proteins.** 

- Non-coding DNA only plays a  role in the **expression of genes.** For example, a nerve cell would not need to produce **haemoglobin, as it is only needed for *red blood cells.*** This means that in a nerve cell, the **gene for haemoglobin is *switched off.*** 

# What is substitution mutation?

Substitution mutation is the only type of mutation you need for this course. Substitution mutation causes **one of the bases** to change to **another random base.**
