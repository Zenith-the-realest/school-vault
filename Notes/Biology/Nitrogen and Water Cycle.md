# Nitrogen and Water Cycle

# Why is nitrogen needed, and what is the issue with nitrogen gas?

The atmosphere contains approx. **78% nitrogen gas,** which is very *unreactive,* so it can't be used *directly* by plants or animals. Nitrogen is required for making **proteins for growth.** 

## How do plants get their nitrogen?

Plants obtain their nitrogen from the soil, which has to be turned into **nitrates ($NO3^-$),** to allow plants to use it. These then pass through food chains as animals and plants eat each other.

## How do decomposers get their nitrogen?

Decomposers, which are bacteria and fungi in soil, **break down proteins** in rotting plants and animals, and **urea in animal waste** into **ammonia, which forms *ammonium ions.*** This returns the nitrogen to the soil, so it is recycled.

## What is **nitrogen fixation?** 

Nitrogen fixation is the process of turning $N_2$ from the air into **nitrogen compounds which plants can use.** This happens one of two main ways:
    - Lightning: it has so much **energy,** that it can cause nitrogen to **react with oxygen** to create **nitrates.** 
    - **Nitrogen fixing bacteria** in roots and soil.

## What are the types of nitrogen fixing bacteria:

- Decomposers: decompose proteins and urea which become ammonia → ammonium ions.
- Nitrifying bacteria: turn **ammonium ions → nitrates.** 
- Nitrogen-fixing bacteria: Turn atmospheric $N_2$ into **nitrogen compounds usable by plants.** 
- Denitrifying bacteria: turn nitrates → $N_2$ gas, which does not benefit anyone. Found in **waterlogged soil.** 

### Where do nitrogen fixing bacteria live?

Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in the **soil,** and others live in **nodules in the roots of *legume plants (like peas and beans.)*** This means that these legume plants are good at putting nitrogen back into soil.
    - The plants have a **mutualistic relationship** with the bacteria: the bacteria get **food (sugars from the plants), and the plant gets nitrogen compounds from bacteria to make protein -** both the plants and the bacteria benefit.

# What is the Water Cycle?

- The Sun makes water **evaporate from the land and sea,** making it into water vapour.
- This water vapour is **carried upwards (due to warm air rising)**, and as it gets higher, it **cools and condenses, which forms clouds.** 
- Water falls from the clouds as **precipitation,** (usually rain, but sometimes snow or hail,) and returns to the land / sea, where the cycle repeats.

## Why is this important?

The continuous flow of fresh water allows the **transportation of nutrients to different ecosystems,** along with water being vital for animal / plant survival itself.
