# Photosynthesis

# What is photosynthesis?

Photosynthesis is when plants take in **carbon dioxide and water,** and the aforementioned substances react to form **glucose and oxygen.** Some oxygen is used in respiration, but the rest is released into the environment - the plant uses the glucose as its food.

The equation for photosynthesis is $$6CO_2 + ^H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_12_O_6 + 6O_2$$

## Where does photosynthesis occur?

It takes place in the **chloroplast.** This means that it mostly takes place in the **leaf,** but a small amount is in the green stem.

- Leaves and stems are green because they contain **chlorophyll** in the chloroplasts.

## What are the stages of photosynthesis?

1 - Light dependent stage: Energy transferred from light **splits water molecules into oxygen gas and hydrogen ions**.
2 - Light independent stage: Carbon dioxide gas combines with the hydrogen ions to make **glucose.** 

# How is the glucose used? 

- The plant immediately uses some in **respiration.**
- However some are converted into other sugar molecules, like fructose and sucrose.
- Glucose that isn't needed straight away is **converted to starch.**
    - This provides an energy store to be used at night, when the plant **cannot photosynthesise.**
