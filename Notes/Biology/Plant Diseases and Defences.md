# Plant Diseases and Defences

## What can plants catch diseases from?

1. Micro-organisms like **fungi, viruses and bacteria.** 
2. Larger organisms, like **insects.** 
3. Deficiency disorders, like a lack of **magnesium ions or nitrate ions.**
> Nitrate ions are needed to form **proteins,** and magnesium for creation of **chlorophyll,** used for photosynthesis. A lack of magnesium causes **chlorosis,** which is caused by a lack of chlorophyll, denoted by the ***yellow leaves*** 

## What are common plant symptoms of disease?

- Abnormal growths / lumps
- Patches of decay
- Discolouration of leaves
- Malformed stem / leaves

> In some cases, you could even see the responsible organism, like **aphids or spider mites.** 

## How do you diagnose plant disease?

- Basic observations, like matching the visible symptoms to a disease listed in a gardening website / manual.
- Sending a **DNA sample** to a **plant pathologist (specialist in plant disease)** to do more *specialised testing.* 
    - Look into a microscope to see the problems in more detail
    - Look for **unique antigens from particular pathogens**, using ***monoclonal antibodies.*** 
    - DNA tests to look for **pathogen DNA.** 
- Trial and error: if you see the plant has yellow leaves and suspect a **magnesium deficiency,** you could give it magnesium and see if it fixes it. If you think its a fungal disease, you could spray it with **fungicides.** 
    - Benefit is that if you try one thing, you can try something else.

# Plant defences:

They can split into three groups:
1. Physical → Physically protect entry of pathogens
    - Examples: **Waxy cuticle**, which covers the leaves and stems, **cellulose cell walls**, and layer of **dead cells** (like bark.)
2. Chemical → Chemicals that the plants can secrete
    - Examples: **Anti-microbial substances** that can kill *bacteria or fungi* that can kill bacteria or fungi, **poisons** that deter or kill **insects.**
> Plants make so many different chemicals, that our medicines are often **derived from plant defenses, such as aspirin.**
3. Mechanical - similar to **physical,** but actually provide a function rather than just being a barrier.
    - Examples: **Thorns and hairs** that stop animals from eating / touching, or **leaves that curl or droop** when insects land on them.
