# The Carbon Cycle

# How are materials in an ecosystem recycled?

An ecosystem is **all the organisms in an area, along with the conditions.** 

The materials are recycled by the **biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors.** 

## Process of recycling:

- The organisms are **made of elements taken from environment,** like plants taking in *carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.* 
    - They use these elements to form complex compounds (such as **carbohydrates and proteins**), which are then taken in by **consumers.** 
- The elements are recycled via **waste products** or the *death of the organisms,* which allow the elements to be reused by other plants and return to the food chain.

# What is the **carbon cycle?** 

## How much carbon is there in the world?

There is a **fixed amount of carbon** in the world, but it is constantly recycled. It is very important as it makes up lots of living organisms. The carbon cycle is as such:

## What to understand from the carbon cycle:

- One arrow **down from CO2 in the air -** the whole process is due to **photosynthesis**.
- Eating passes carbon compounds in the plant to animals in the food chain
- Respiration from both plants and animals release CO2.
- Plants and animals eventually **decompose or are killed**, where they turn into useful products.
    - Some of these products, like **wood and fossil fuels,** are burnt (combustion), releasing **CO2** back into the atmosphere.
- Decomposition means that habitats are maintained: **nutrients are returned to soil,** and **waste material doesn't pile up.**
