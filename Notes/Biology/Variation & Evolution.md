# Variation & Evolution

# What is variation?

Variation is the **differences in individuals.** This is due to different **phenotypes.** These different phenotypes are due to different **genes,** which code for specific proteins. A person's genome is their entire genetic makeup. This means that each person's **genome is unique, other than *identical twins.*** 
## What are factors affecting variation?

Although identical twins might have identical genomes, one might be taller than the other due to differences in their **environment.** 

This means that the factors that affect our **observable characteristics are our *genes* and *environment.*** 

# Why is there so much genetic variation?

There is lots of genetic variations due to **mutations, which change the proteins.**

However, most mutations do **not have an effect on proteins, therefore not affecting phenotypes.** Although this is usually the case, when they **do have an effect,** it is usually something bad, but very occasionally, it could be something good, such as being able to **run faster, or more resistant to (lung) disease.** 

## What do beneficial mutations do?

These make them more survival, and therefore more **able to reproduce,** which passes on their characteristics. **Darwin coined this** *natural selection,* which is what he discovered after noticing that the useful traits were passed on the most.
However, Darwin's most important idea was **evolution,** which was the idea that the  inheritance of certain characteristics, over multiple generations could lead to a **change in the whole species.**
