# Alloys

# What is an alloy?

An alloy is a mixture of **two or more different metals.** 
They can also be mixtures of metals and non-metals, like **steel.** What makes alloys useful is that they have **different properties to the pure versions of their components -** and these properties often make them **more useful.** 

# Steel:

Steel is an alloy of **iron and carbon.** Steel is stronger than iron, given the **amount of carbon is not >1%.** It is also more resistant to **rust, unlike iron.** Lots of things are made from steel, such as **bridges, engine parts, and cutlery.** 

# Other alloys:

## Brass:

- Alloy of **copper and zinc**
- Properties a mixture of both, but **harder than both of them**.
- Used for musical instruments

## Bronze:

- Alloy of **copper and tin**
- Harder / stronger than tin, and more **resistant to corrosion.** 
- Used for sculptures, bearings, bells and springs.

## Solder:

- Alloy of **lead and tin**.
- No definite melting point, but **solidifies as it cools**.
    - Makes it useful for joining metals together, such as **electronic circuits.**
- Low melting point means you can melt it **without deforming other components in the circuit.** 

## Duralumin:

- Alloy mostly **aluminium (94%), small amounts of copper (4%), and magnesium (about 1%), and even smaller amounts of manganese.** 
- **Low density** alloy, much stronger than aluminium.
- Used to make **parts of aeroplanes and other aircraft.**
