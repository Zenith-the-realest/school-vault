## What is corrosion?

Corrosion is **the process by which metals are *slowly broken down* by reacting with substances in their environment.** 

### Examples of corrosion:

An example of corrosion is **rusting:** the production of hydrated iron (III) oxide when oxygen reacts with water: $$Iron + Oxygen + Water \rightarrow Hydrated\space Iron(III)\space Oxide$$

The ionic half equations are:

$$Fe \rightarrow Fe^{3+} + 3e^-$$

$$O_2 + 4e^- \rightarrow 2O^{2-}$$

Here, the iron is **oxidised**, as it **loses** electrons, and the oxygen is **reduced,** as it **gains** electrons.
>This means that rusting is a **redox reaction,** meaning that reduction and oxidation occur in the **same reaction.** 

## What conditions are required for **rust** to take place?

Rusting requires **water, iron, and oxygen** to take place.

>This means that if there were 3 test tubes, one with **one with water and no oxygen,** one with **no water and oxygen,** and one with **both water and oxygen,** the only one where rusting would take place would be the third one, as there is a presence of both water and oxygen.

>In corrosion, it is only **the surface of the metal** that corrodes.
>However, the only reason that iron **decreases** is because the rust *flakes off,* exposing the non-corroded metal.
>However, in most cases, such as aluminium corroding to form **aluminium oxide,** the metal will not flake away, and the **aluminium oxide forms a *protective layer.*** 

## How do we ***prevent*** corrosion?

There are two categories of methods that prevent corrosion: **barrier and sacrificial.** 

### Barrier methods:

Barrier methods **prevent oxygen and water from** touching the iron. Examples include:

1 - **Painting it** - this works well for larger pieces.

2 - **Oil / Grease** - necessary for objects that have moving parts.

3 - **Electroplating** - Using *electrolysis* to cover the iron in a thin layer of another metal, which **protects the metal underneath.** 

### Sacrificial methods:

Sacrificial methods **add a more reactive metal to the iron.

- For iron, you could add **aluminium or zinc,** meaning if the object is exposed to oxygen, the more reactive metal will corrode instead of the iron.

>An example that uses ***both methods*** is called **galvanising.** This involves coating the metal in a layer of zinc.

This is a barrier method because it **forms a protective coating,** and also a sacrifical method because that even when the iron is exposed, the zinc will react with any oxygen.
