## What is corrosion?

Corrosion is **the process by which metals are *slowly broken down* by reacting with substances in their environment.** 

### Examples of corrosion:

An example of corrosion is **rusting:** the production of hydrated iron (III) oxide when oxygen reacts with water: $$Iron + Oxygen + Water \rightarrow Hydrated\space Iron(III)\space Oxide$$

The ionic half equations are:
$$Fe \rightarrow Fe^{3+} + 3e^-$$

$$O_2 + 4e^- \rightarrow 2O^{2-}$$

Here, the iron is **oxidised**, as it **loses** electrons, and the oxygen is **reduced,** as it **gains** electrons.
>This means that rusting is a **redox reaction,** meaning that reduction and oxidation occur in the **same reaction.**
