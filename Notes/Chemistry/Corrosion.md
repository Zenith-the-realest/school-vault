## What is corrosion?

Corrosion is **the process by which metals are *slowly broken down* by reacting with substances in their environment.** 

### Examples of corrosion:

An example of corrosion is **rusting:** the production of hydrated iron (III) oxide when oxygen reacts with water: $$Iron + Oxygen + Water \rightarrow Hydrated\space Iron(III)\space Oxide$$.

The ionic half equations are:
$$Fe \rightrrow Fe^3 ^+$$
