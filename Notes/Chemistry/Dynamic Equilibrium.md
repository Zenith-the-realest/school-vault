# Dynamic Equilibrium

Dynamic equilibrium is a state that can be achieved in **reversible reactions.** Reversible reactions are when reactants react to form products, but those products can also **form reactants.** 

This is usually signified with a harpoon arrow (⇌), e.g:

$A + B$ ⇌ $C + D$

## What is equilibrium?

As the reactants (which are A and B in this case), react, they **decrease in concentration.** This means that the *forward reaction slows down.* This means more and more of the products (C and D) re made, meaning their **concentration rises.** 

This results in the **backward reaction (C + D reacting to make A + B)** speeding up.

Equilibrium occurs when **both reactions** are occurring, but there is **no overall effect (on concentration).**

This means that the **concentrations of reactants and products** have reached a *balance,* and ***will not change.*** 

> Equilibrium can only be reached if the reaction occurs in a **"closed system."** A closed system means that the reactants and products **can't escape.** 

# What does an equilibrium's "position" mean?

Although the **concentrations** are equal at equilibrium, it does **not** mean the amounts of them are equal.

- The equilibrium can lie to the right - i.e **lots of products / less reactants,** or lie to the left, meaning **lots of reactants / less products.** 

The position of equilibrium depends on **conditions, as well as the reaction itself.**
