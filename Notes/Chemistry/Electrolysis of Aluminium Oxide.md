# Electrolysis of Aluminium Oxide

## Why can't we use **carbon reduction** for more reactive metals?

In carbon reduction, the metal is displaced by carbon due to it being more reactive. This means that it will **only apply to metals *less* reactive than carbon,** so metals like **potassium, sodium and lithium (for example, not limited to these)** cannot be reduced with carbon.


# Electrolysis:

Electrolysis can split aluminium oxide into aluminium and oxide.

In its original form, aluminium oxide is a solid, and found as an ore called **bauxite.** This ore needs to be *purified (details unneeded)* and then melted so the ions are free to move around and electrolysis can be done to it.

The problem is that aluminium oxide has a **very high melting point.** To circumvent this, it is mixed with a mineral called **cryolite,** which lowers it. (It is still reasonably high, but less so.)

## Setting up electrolysis:

We need the beaker filled with the electrolyte, with the anode and cathode connected via a wire with a power supply.
(More details in [[Electrolysis]] as to why this equipment is used)

## What happens in the process?

In the process, the negative oxide ions are attracted to the positive anode, where they are **discharged (see definition in [[Electrolysis]])**, which forms oxygen. The discharged electrons then travel from the anode along the wire to the negative cathode, where the positive aluminium ions are attracted to. Here, the electrons are given to the aluminium, making it into pure aluminium which collects at the bottom.

### Half equations (and full equation) for this process:

As you know, oxidation takes place at the anode (oxygen), and reduction takes place at the cathode (aluminium).

Half equation for oxygen: $2O^{2-}\rightarrow O_2 + 4e^-$
Half equation for aluminium: $Al^{3+} + 3e^- \rightarrow Al$

#### Overall equation:

The full equation for this is: $$2Al_2O_3\rightarrow 4Al_{(l)}+2O_{2\space (l)}$$
