# Electrolysis of Aluminium Oxide

## Why can't we use **carbon reduction** for more reactive metals?

In carbon reduction, the metal is displaced by carbon due to it being more reactive. This means that it will **only apply to metals *less* reactive than carbon,** so metals like **potassium, sodium and lithium (for example, not limited to these)** cannot be reduced with carbon.


# Electrolysis:

Electrolysis can split aluminium oxide into aluminium and oxide.

In its original form, aluminium oxide is a solid, and found as an ore called **bauxite.** This ore needs to be *purified (details unneeded)* and then melted so the ions are free to move around and electrolysis can be done to it.

The problem is that aluminium oxide has a **very high melting point.** To circumvent this, it is mixed with a mineral called **cryolite,** which lowers it. (It is still reasonably high, but less so.)

## Setting up electrolysis:

We need the beaker filled with the electrolyte, with the anode and cathode connected via a wire with a power supply.
(More details in [[Electrolysis]] as to why this equipment is used)
