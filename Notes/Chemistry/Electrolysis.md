# Electrolysis

# Equipment required:

- Beaker: Contains the **electrolyte -** a liquid or solution that contains ions (that are free to move)
    - When the metal is a solid, like lead bromide, it has to be **melted**,       
        - This is because the ions in the metal($Pb^_{2+}$ and $Br^-$) need to be free to move around, which does not happen in a solid.
    - However, if it is *soluble*, like $CuSO_4$, you can simply make it into a solution.

- Electrodes: Solid conductors made of **metal or carbon.** The positive electrode is **the anode,** and the negative electrode is **the cathode.** 

- Wire: Allows electrons to flow between them.

- Power Supply: Drives the flow of electrons.

# What is electrolysis?

Electrolysis is the use of electricity to break down electrolytes to form elements.

# How does it work?

Using the example of lead bromide:

- The negative bromide ions are attracted to the positive anode, where they are **discharged, meaning they** *go from a charged ion to a neutral atom* 
    - Because it is bromine, the atoms are **bromine gas,** which will float off.
- The positive lead ions are attracted to the negative cathode, where they are also discharged.
    - This forms pure lead, which falls to the bottom as a layer of molten lead.

## Oxidation and reduction:

At the anode, the bromine is **oxidised,** as it *loses electrons.* 
The half equation is $2Br^-\rightarrow Br_2 + 2e^-$

At the cathode, the lead is **reduced,** as it *gains electrons.* 
The half equation is $Pb^{2+} + 2e^-\rightarrow Pb

### What actually happens to the electrons?

The extra electrons from the bromine are transported from the anode along the wire to the cathode. Here, they **give their electrons to the lead, making it *neutral***.
