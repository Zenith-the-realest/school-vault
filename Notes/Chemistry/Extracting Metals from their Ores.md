# Extracting Metals from their Ores

# What is an ore?

An ore is a rock that contains **enough metal** to make extraction of the metal *economically worthwhile.* 

# How are metals extracted from their ores?

Metals can be extracted from their ores **chemically:** 

- Using reduction (less reactive than carbon)
- Or electrolysis (more reactive than carbon)

## How are metals extracted with reduction?

Metals can be **extracted using *carbon reduction.*** 
When an ore is **reduced,** it *loses oxygen.* An example equation of a carbon displacement is $$2CO + C \rightarrow 2Cu + CO_2$$

Here, the copper is displaced by the carbon. The **position of the metal in the reactivity series dictates how easy it is to reduce.** See the reactivity series here:

- Metals higher than carbon need to be extracted with **electrolysis, which is *expensive.***
- Metals below carbon can be extracted using the above reduction (e.g iron oxide)
    - This is because the carbon can only displace the metal if it is **more reactive.**
