# Extracting Metals with Electrolysis

Electrolysis is **expensive, but very useful.** 
## Why is electrolysis used?

Electrolysis is used for metals more reactive than carbon. The metal has to be **molten (so the ions are free (see [[Electrolysis]] for more info)).**

# Process:

Once the metal is melted, an electric current is passed through it. The metal is discharged at the **cathode,** and the non-metal at the **anode.** 

A disadvantage of this is it is very expensive.

> See [[Electrolysis of Aluminium Oxide]] for more in-depth example.

## How else can electrolysis be used?

Electrolysis can also be used to **purify copper.** Copper can be reduced with carbon in a **furnace (called smelting), but the resulting copper isn't very pure.**

- This is an issue as copper is used as a conductor, and impure copper doesn't conduct very well.

# What other methods of extracting metals are there?

There are two other methods of extraction, which are **biological:**
- Bioleaching
- Phytoextraction

## Bioleaching:

This uses bacteria to separate metals from ores, such as copper being separated from copper sulfide. The bacteria get energy from the **bonds between the atoms,** which separate out the metal from the ore. The **leachate (solution produced by this process)** contains metal ions, which can be extracted by **electrolysis or displaced with a more reactive metal.** 

## Phytoextraction:

This involves growing **plants** in soil that **contains metal compounds.** The plants can't use these metals, so they build up in the leaves. The plants can be **harvested, dried, or burned in a furnace.** The resultant ash contains the metal compounds, where the metal can also be extracted via **electrolysis or displacement.** 

### What are the advantages and disadvantages of biological methods?

They are less **harmful to the environment compared to electrolysis and carbon reduction,** but are also **much slower.**
