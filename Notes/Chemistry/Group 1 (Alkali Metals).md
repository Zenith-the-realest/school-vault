# Group 1 (Alkali Metals)

# Properties:

## Softness and Low Density:

Alkali metals are usually **soft and low density,** unlike most other metals, which are *strong and high density.* 

## Reactivity:

Alkali metals are notably more reactive than other metals, as they **react vigorously with water, oxygen and *group 7* elements like *chlorine.*** 
- Reactivity also **increases as you go down the group.** For example, **Caesium** is so reactive that it ignites at room temperature.


### Why does reactivity change in this way?

The **electron configuration of** group 1 elements means that they have a **single electron in the outer shell.** This ability to lose their electron so easily makes them so reactive.

As you move down the group, the atomic radius increases, which results in a ***further distance of the outermost electron to the nucleus.*** This means that the **attractive force is weakened,** so it is able to lose it easier, thus increasing reactivity.
## Melting and Boiling Points:

As you move down the group, there is a **decrease in melting and boiling points.** 

## Forming ionic compounds:

Alkali metals are easily able to **form ionic compounds, as they can lose electrons easily.** 
- The process of ionic bonding includes the **donation of electrons (from a metal)** to a **non-metal,** which makes ***oppositely charged ions that are attracted to each other,*** forming compounds.

> **Table salt** (sodium chloride) is an example of this. 

# Specific reactions:

- With water, alkali metals produce ***metal hydroxides and hydrogen gas.*** 
- With chlorine, alkali metals react to form **white metal chloride salts.** 
- With oxygen, alkali metals form **metal oxides,** with specific compounds per metal.
