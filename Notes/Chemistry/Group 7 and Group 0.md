# Group 7 and Group 0

## What are Group 7 elements known as?

Group 7 elements are known as **Halogens.** 

## Properties:

- Fluorine: poisonous yellow gas, highly reactive.
- Chlorine: less reactive than fluorine, poisonous green gas.
- Bromine: Reddish-brown volatile liquid which is also poisonous
- Iodine: Dark gray solid that can form poisonous purple vapours. Also used as **antiseptic.** 

### How do Group 7 elements form?

All halogens exist as diatomic molecules, which are formed by sharing electrons to create covalent bonds.

### Reactivity:

This works the **opposite to Group 1:** melting and boiling points **increase** down the group, whereas reactivity **ecreases** down the group. This is due to the fact that Group 7 electrons have seven electrons in their outer shell, meaning they want to gain one to have a full outer shell. This means that increasing atomic radius decreases attraction to nucleus, making it ***harder to gain an electron, decreasing reactivity.*** 


## Formation of ionic bonds:

Halogens can also form ionic bonds with **metals** (e.g Group 1!)

- Halogens can gain electrons to become **halide ions.** 

## What are Group 8 elements known as?

Group 8 elements are known as the **Noble Gases, due to them not being reactive.** They exist as colourless gases, and exist as single atoms (also being non-flammable).

## Why are they not reactive?

They have a full outer shell.

## How do boiling points change?

They are similar to halogens, as boiling points of noble gases **increase down the group.**
