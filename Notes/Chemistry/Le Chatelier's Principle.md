# Le Chatelier's Principle

## What is Le Chatelier's Principle?

Le Chatelier's principle states that any change you make to a **reversible reaction,** the equilibrium position *will move,* in order to undo your change.

# Changes in temperature:

In all reversible reactions, one direction will be an **exothermic reaction,** and another reaction will be **endothermic.** 

##### Decreasing temperature:
This means that if you decrease temperature, the equilibrium will move in the **exothermic direction -** so it can produce heat to counteract the decrease.

##### Increasing temperature:

The opposite applies to increasing temperature - if you increase temperature, the equilibrium moves in the **endothermic direction,** meaning it will absorb the extra heat you have given it.
