# Le Chatelier's Principle

Le Chatelier's Principle states that if any changes are made to a reversible reaction, the **equilibrium will move to reverse that change.** This applies to **three conditions:** 
1. Temperature
2. Pressure (for gaseous molecules)
3. Concentrations

## How do changes in these affect the equilibrium?

### Temperature

#### Increase:


#### Decrease:


### Pressure

#### Increase:

#### Decrease:
