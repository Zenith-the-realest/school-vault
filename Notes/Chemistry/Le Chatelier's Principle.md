# Le Chatelier's Principle

Le Chatelier's Principle states that if any changes are made to a reversible reaction, the **equilibrium will move to reverse that change.** This applies to **three conditions:** 
1. Temperature
2. Pressure (for gaseous molecules)
3. Concentrations

## How do changes in these affect the equilibrium?

### Temperature

#### Increase:

Increase in temperature means that the equilibrium wishes to **decrease the temperature.** This means that it would favour the **endothermic reaction,** which ***takes in energy,*** decreasing temperature.

#### Decrease:

Opposite applies to decrease: the equilibrium wants to **increase temperature** to counteract it, meaning it favours the **exothermic reaction,** which ***releases energy,*** increasing temperature.
### Pressure
*Note: only applies to **gaseous molecules.*** 
#### Increase:

#### Decrease:
