# Life Cycle Assessments

## What are life cycle assessments?

They **analyze a product's environmental impact** across different stages.

## What are stages of life cycle assessments?

1. Extracting and processing materials
2. Manufacturing and packaging
3. Using product
4. Disposing of the product

### Environmental impact at each stage:

Resource extraction - direct damage caused, like **deforestation or mining.** Indirect damage includes **energy consumption, and release of pollution during processing.**

Manufacturing and packaging - **energy usage, pollution and waste production.** ***Disposal of waste products*** is also a concern.

Product use - environmental damage caused during **product lifetime and duration of use.** 

Disposal - landfill disposal takes up **space, and can lead to *chemical seepage.*** Burning waste products can release **pollutants into atmosphere.** 

# Comparing **plastic bags** to **paper bags:** 

Raw Materials: Plastic bags use **finite crude oil,** while paper bags use **wood from trees, which impact habitats.** 

Manufacturing: Plastic bags use polymerization from cracked hydrocarbons, while paper bags use energy intensive pulping processes.

Product use: Plastic bags can be reused multiple times, but paper are generally single-use

Disposal: Plastic bags are **non-biodegradable,** and **harm landfills,** but paper bags are **biodegradable and less toxic.** 

# What are limitations of life cycle assessments?

- Complexity: assessing every production step is difficult, specifically **quantifying harm.** 
- Manipulation: assessments can be manipulated to **favor particular companies,** for advertising.
