# Separation of Metals from Metal Oxides

> *Metals are usually found in **oxide form**, meaning we have to extract the metal from that*.
# What is oxidation and reduction?

Oxidation is defined as the **gain of oxygen,** and reduction the **loss of oxygen.** 

Examples:

Oxidation - $2Mg + O_2 \rightarrow 2MgO$
o> Here, the magnesium has gained oxygen, therefore it is **oxidised.**
Reduction - $2MgO \rightarrow 2Mg + O_2$
> Here, the magnesium oxide has reduced to become magnesium + oxygen, and therefore it is **reduced.** 

Because most metals are reactive, they will form **metal oxides**. For example, iron; usually it reacts with the oxygen in the air to form iron oxide (a.k.a rust).

>*However, the exceptions are **very unreactive** metals, such as platinum.* 
>*These are usually found as **pure metals*** 

# How do we get rid of anything reacted with a metal?

We usually want the metal in its purest form, when it is an element on its own, (*i.e $Cu$, $Fe$, etc.*)
This means we have to remove its oxide (or whatever the metal is bound to.) There are two methods to doing this:

## Carbon reduction:

Carbon reduction is essentially when carbon **takes the element from the metal,** and the pure metal is left behind. An example of this is:

- $2CuO + C \rightarrow 2Cu + CO_2$

>*This can only be done when the metal is **less** reactive than carbon.*
