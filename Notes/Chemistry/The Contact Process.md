# The Contact Process

## What is the Contact Process?

Industrial method that involves **reversible reactions** used to manufacture *sulfuric acid.* There are 3 main steps:

# Step 1: Making sulfur dioxide:

Sulfur is **combusted with oxygen, forming sulfur dioxide:** 

$$S_8+8O_2 \rightarrow 8SO_2$$

# Step 2: Oxidation of sulfur dioxide:

*Note: catalyst of vanadium (V) oxide used* 

$2SO_2 + O_2$ ⇄ $2SO_3$

# Step 3: Synthesising sulfuric acid:

$$SO_3 + H_2O \rightarrow H_2SO_4$$

## What are the conditions of the contact process?

Temperature - 450°C.
Pressure - 2 atm
Catalyst - Vanadium (V) oxide.

## What has to be considered for conditions?

- Yield 
- Rate 
- Cost

### Why is that temp used?

High temperatures increase rate of reaction, but decrease yield due to forward reaction being exothermic. 450°C works as a **compromise.** 

### Why is that pressure used?

Higher pressures increase rate of reaction (and yield) but causes increased cost.

### Catalyst used for?

No effect on percentage yield, but increases rate of reaction.
