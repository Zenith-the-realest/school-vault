# The Reactivity Series and Displacement Reactions

## How do metals react?

Metals react by **losing outer shell electrons, which *form positive ions.*** 

### How does the reactivity series organise metals?

They organise metals depending on how **easily they form these ions.** Group 1 metals are **highly reactive,** and the **transition metals are the *least reactive.*** 

## How is metal reactivity tested?

To establish the series, metals are reacted with **acid or water.** The *speed or violence of the reactions* indicate their relative reactivities.

### How are reactivities fairly compared?

The metals have to be of **equal mass, surface area,** and the **concentration of the acids have to be the same.** 

### What do metals produce when reacting with acid?

When metals react with acid, they form **salts and hydrogen.** Reactivity increases from **copper to potassium,** as potassium reacts explosively, compared to an almost absent reaction by copper.

## What are displacement reactions?

Displacement reactions occur when a **more reactive metal** is involved in a reaction with a **less reactive metal.** In this case, the more reactive metal would **displace** the less reactive metal from its compound.
