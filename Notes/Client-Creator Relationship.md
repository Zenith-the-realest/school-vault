# Client-Creator Relationship



## What are client requirements?

Client requirements are what the client (a person, organisation / company) wants from the person they request services from (e.g a designer). They can include the type of product, its purpose, its intended audience, etc.

*See [[Client Requirements]].*

## How do clients communicate their requirements?

Clients communicate their requirements in several ways â€“ see [[Communicating Client Briefs]].

They can be communicated formally in **written form** or as **commissions**. Informally, they can be done through a **discussion**. They usually have negotiation.
