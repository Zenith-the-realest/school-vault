# Communicating Client Briefs

Clients can communicate briefs in different ways:

- A client can provide **written** briefs or **commissions** requesting work to be completed.
	- These are **formal** documents.
- The client may provide their brief during a **formal meeting** or a **discussion** (face to face / over the phone). Discussions are usually **informal**.

- No matter how it is discussed, there will be some **negotiation** between them and the design team.
	- For example, there may be a non-achievable deadline, in which case a **new deadline** will be proposed.
