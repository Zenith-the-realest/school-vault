# Context of Ozymandias

## Who was Percy Shelley?

Percy Shelley was a **Romantic poet**, who was *vegetarian, anti-monarchy, an atheist, pacifist, anti-religious* and a supporter of *social justice.*

## What was the Romantic Era?

During the Age of Enlightenment (an age driven by a mindset that favoured **science and reason** over **religion**), writers (including Shelley) would protest the present / future of mankind.
- They did this by using **old literary conventions**  and repurposing them.
These poems rejected institutions of power, and the poetry was used to spread **messages and political ideas.**

## Historical influence in Ozymandias:

### Ramesses II:

The first reference is in the name of the poem itself: “Ozymandias” was the throne name of **Ramesses II**, an Egyptian pharaoh from 1279-1239 BC.

Shelley made his statue the topic of his poem, as it was recently discovered during his time of writing.

### King George III:

It is arguable that George III had influence over the poem, as he has reigned longer than any king, but (in Shelley and many others’ opinions) had overstayed. He engaged in many military conflicts and was remembered to be oppressive and tyrannical – similar to Ozymandias.
