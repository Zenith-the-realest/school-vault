# Context of The Prelude

## Wordsworth:

Wordsworth was a **romantic poet**, who resisted growing industrialism in favour of the simpler past. It could be said that industrial Britain inspired him to explore his own development that is seen in “The Prelude”. The poem also has a **message of warning** to the **contemporary society.**

## What was The Prelude intended to be?

The poem was intended to be a **prologue** to **The Recluse**, the latter designed to be a *three part epic*, which he never finished. The work was meant to rival **Milton’s Paradise Lost**, and the fact that he could never finish it plagued him according to his letters.

## What does The Prelude explore?

The Prelude mainly explores the conflict between humans and nature, or **man vs nature**, investigated through a young man’s attempt to *control nature*, via his rowing boat.
