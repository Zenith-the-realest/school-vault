# Electrical power

# What is **power?** 

Power is the energy transferred **per second,** or the **rate of work done.** Power is measured in **watts (W)**, but larger powers are measured in **kilowatts (kW)**. The regular equation for power is:

**power = energy / time** 

but the equation which relates to **electrical power** is different.

# How to calculate electric power with electrical values:

There are two equations for electrical power:

**Power = (current)² x resistance** 
**Power = current x voltage** 

The one on top works because voltage = current x resistance, meaning it is effectively "current x current x resistance," which is (current)² x resistance.
