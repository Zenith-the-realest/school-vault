## Who was Wilfred Owen?

- Wilfred Owen was born in **1893,** and joined the **British Army in 1915, dying in battle on *November 4th 1918***.
- He originally wanted to pursue a career in **the Church**, but gave up because he felt that **the Church failed to care for those in its locality.** 
- Owen was a fan of the poet **John Keats (1795-1821), who also died at 25.** 

## War Poetry:

> **Before Owen, war poetry was usually patriotic, praising brave soldiers and glorifying battle (see [[Charge Of The Light Brigade - Poem|Charge Of The Light Brigade]] by Tennyson.**

This was because war attitudes were unrealistic before WW1; **Britain had not experienced major war for a hundred years.** This meant that participation in war was considered brave, honorable and exiciting - Owen wished to dismiss this myth, and "expose" reality. This is why *the futility of war* is a major theme in his poem (this is echoed in Ted Hughes's (*Bayonet Charge*).

## What is the poem about?

The poem is about **Owen's experiences in trench warfare.** It describes how a group of soldiers suffered in their harsh weather conditions, hoping to return home and wondering why they had offered themselves up for this terrible experience.
