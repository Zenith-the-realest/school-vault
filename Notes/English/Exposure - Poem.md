# Exposure - Poem

# Theme:

In "Exposure", the theme of the *futility of war* is at the forefront. The title could be misleading; readers may believe that the "exposure" is exposure to enemy soldiers, but the poem is **devoid of action,** as it focuses on the experience of soldiers in the trenches - it is the "exposure" of the soldiers to the **harsh weather conditions,** or the "exposure" of the truth of war to **the British public.** 

# Structure:

Each stanza starts with a blunt and powerful sentence:
>*Our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knive us..*

followed with emotive vocabulary such as *"wearied","low drooping","confuse","worried".* 

However, each stanza ends with an anti-climax:
>*But nothing happens.* 

This structure is apparent in each verse. It may be that Owen intends for the reader to *emphasise with what thte soldier's felt:* everything is tense and building to a climax, but ending with nothing.
This reflects the emotional roller coaster the soldiers went through everyday, exhausting them.

## Rhyme scheme:

The rhyme scheme is ABBAC throughout; the first four rules establish a ***rhyme pattern,*** but the last line breaks it, also reflecting the momentum / emotional buildup the soldiers went through, to be met with nothing.

This rhyme scheme remains for the entire poem, its repetitive nature reflecting the **repetitive and futile situation** the soldiers are stuck in - as the poem stays the same, the situation stays for the soldiers.

>***In addition, these rhymes are not even full rhymes, reflecting the unease - this is called <u>pararhyme</u>.***
>*An example of this is "knive us" followed by "nervous": These only partially rhyme, reflecting the permanent sense of being nervously on edge.* 

# Language:

## Biblical imagery:

Owen describes the distant gunfire as a "dull rumour of some other war." This could be the soldiers thinking that they are **detached form whatever battle is occurring elsewhere,** as they are attempting to survive the harsh weather conditions. However, this could also be a biblical allusion: In Matthew 24, jesus mentions "you will hear of wars and rumours of wars", his point being that **the end of the world will come with no one's notice.** However, the point that Owen's reference makes is that **the end of the world has already come for the freezing soldiers.** 

## Personification:

Owen uses personification to **highlight the fact that weather is more *dangerous* than the *"less deadly bullets."*** 

>*"winds that knive us"*
>*"mad gusts"* 
>*"Dawn massing in the east / her melancholy army"* 
>*"air that shudders with black ice"* 
>*"pale flakes with finger stealth"* 

This use of personification presents the idea that nature is more deadly than the enemy. This is further emphasised in Owen's use of militaristic language to describe the rain, which *"attacks once more in ranks".* 
## The final lines:

The final lines of the last four verses are:

>*"What are we doing here?"*
>*"Is it that we are dying?"*
>*"We turn back to our dying"*
>*"For love of God is dying."*

These stanzas relate to each other; the **second** answers the **first,** and the third and final lines are a response to this query and response. The last line (**"For love of God is dying"** ) is ambiguous: it could be suggesting that people lose their religious beliefs in the face of the horrors of war (knowing that Owen rejected the church), or it could mean that this harsh and brutal weather was God's punishment to them.

## Sibilance:

>*"Sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence"* 
>*"Pale flakes with fingering stealth come feeling for our faces-"* 

The sinister sound created by this sibilance could mean:
- The hissing of a snake, reminding the reader of the environmental threats.
- The sound of bullets passing overhead.
- The sound of the shivering soldiers.

## Caesura:

>*"Slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires,glozed*
>*With crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;*
>*For hours the innocent mice rejoice:the house is theres;*
>*Shutters and doors, all closed: on us the doors are closed,*
>*We turn back to our dying""* 

This caesura used shows the division between the soldiers **homes**, and the **present war.** 

## The ending:

The ending is very important; having established before that the soldiers perceive themselves as sacrifices to save the public, the contrasting **"but nothing happens"** ends the poem. Structurally, it ends as it began, showing its cyclical structure and highlighting how futile war is in the end.
