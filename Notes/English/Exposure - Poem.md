# Exposure - Poem

# Theme:

In "Exposure", the theme of the *futility of war* is at the forefront. The title could be misleading; readers may believe that the "exposure" is exposure to enemy soldiers, but the poem is **devoid of action,** as it focuses on the experience of soldiers in the trenches - it is the "exposure" of the soldiers to the **harsh weather conditions,** or the "exposure" of the truth of war to **the British public.**
