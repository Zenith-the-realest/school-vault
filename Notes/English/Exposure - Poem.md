# Exposure - Poem

# Theme:

In "Exposure", the theme of the *futility of war* is at the forefront. The title could be misleading; readers may believe that the "exposure" is exposure to enemy soldiers, but the poem is **devoid of action,** as it focuses on the experience of soldiers in the trenches - it is the "exposure" of the soldiers to the **harsh weather conditions,** or the "exposure" of the truth of war to **the British public.** 

# Structure:

Each stanza starts with a blunt and powerful sentence:
>*Our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knive us..*
followed with emotive vocabulary such as *"wearied","low drooping","confuse","worried".* 

However, each stanza ends with an anti-climax:
>*But nothing happens.* 

This structure is apparent in each verse. It may be that Owen intends for the reader to *emphasise with what thte soldier's felt:* everything is tense and building to a climax, but ending with nothing.
This reflects the emotional roller coaster the soldiers went through everyday, exhausting them.

## Rhyme scheme:

The rhyme scheme is ABBAC throughout; the first four rules establish a ***rhyme pattern,*** but the last line breaks it, also reflecting the momentum / emotional buildup the soldiers went through, to be met with nothing.

This rhyme scheme remains for the entire poem, its repetitive nature reflecting the **repetitive and futile situation** the soldiers are stuck in - as the poem stays the same, the situation stays for the soldiers.

>***In addition, these rhymes are not even full rhymes, reflecting the unease - this is called <u>pararhyme</u>.***
>*An example of this is "knive us" followed by "nervous": These only partially rhyme, reflecting the permanent sense of being nervously on edge.* 

# Language:

## Biblical imagery:

Owen describes the distant gunfire as a "dull rumour of some other war." This could be the soldiers thinking that they are **detached form whatever battle is occurring elsewhere,** as they are attempting to survive the harsh weather conditions. However, this could also be a biblical allusion: In Matthew 24, jesus mentions "you will hear of wars and rumours of wars", his point being that **the end of the world will come with no one's notice.** However, the point that Owen's reference makes is that **the end of the world has already come for the freezing soldiers.**
