# London - Context

## Who was William Blake?

- William Blake, the author of **London**, was born in 1757 in London, where he mainly lived. Even though it may not be, this creates the implication that the "I" in the poem is Blake himself.
- Blake was a **poet, painter, and printmaker**. 
- Blake often wrote about rebellion against **misuse of power** and **class**.

## The industrialisation of London:

When Blake was born, the population of London was **760,000**. 100 years later, this **rose to 3 million**. One of the major influences of this increase, which Blake was also against, was the ***Industrial Revolution***.
> The Industrial Revolution began in 1760. It was simply a shift from **country life -> city life**. There was a boom in machinery, which completed work quicker than humans. This created lots of change in agriculture, manufacturing and transport.

Factories were created, and the conditions in these were terrible - for example, **children** were used as workers, because they were very small, and could fit in and around machinery.

## The publicisation of "London":

London originates from Blake's **"Songs of Experience"**, a companion piece to his **"Songs of Innocence"**. The former, in which London was published, focused on a much **harsher view** of the world, of a world **corrupted by humans**.

When I say "London", I mean the poem, and when I say London, I mean the city.
