# London - The Poem

# Structure:

The poem has a **repetitive structure**: it is written in quatrains (each stanza using 4 lines), with an **ABAB** rhyme scheme. There is a heavy emphasis on **repetition**, which reflects the *relentless, repetitive and overwhelming suffering in the city.*

The repetition also emphasises that the life of suffering is *inescapable*: no one will be able toe scape it, as it is there due to the decisions of people in power.

> The structure of the whole text also matters; the first two stanzas *focus on the sufferers*, whereas stanza three focuses on the *causes*, and then the final stanza focuses on the  *sufferers again*  Yet again, it is cyclical - further emphasising the inescapable fate of the people in the city. 

However, this strict structure is not present everywhere: for example, Blake's use of speech.
Most of the poem is written in *iambic tetrameter*: the **repetition** further emphasises this inescapable life.

> However, not all lines are written in *iambic tetrameter*:
>   "*marks of weakness, marks of woe*"

In the line pointing out the weakness of the sufferers, the line is weak in its use of syllables: it contains less than the other lines. The weakening of this line is intentional, and truly reflects the weakness of the sufferers.


# Language:

> The poem predominantly presents the suffering of those of London: *"marks of weakness, marks of woe","cry of every man", "cry of every man", "cry of fear", "mind-forged manacles", "chimney-sweeper's cry", "hapless soldier's sigh", "youthful harlot's curse", "new-born infant's tear", "blights with plagues"* - the negative language is very obvious.

### The use of "Charter'd":

In the beginning, the use of "*charter'd*" is very clear. If something is "*charter'd*", it is under a legal contract. Between **1760 and 1820**, approximately *6 million acres of land* in England was charter'd (privately owned). The first usage of "charter'd" in the poem could refer to the fact that the properties around the speaker was privately owned. However, the repetition is ironic: "the charter'd Thames does flow" - here, the force of human power is emphasised due to the fact that it is controlling something natural: a river. The juxtaposition of natural power and human power shows that the *attempt of humans to control nature* is a cause of the suffering that the people experience, as the gap between the poor and the rich get wider, as the expanse of the latter's control increases.

### The use of "mark":

Another example of repetition is in the word "mark":

> *"And **mark** in every face I meet <br>
> **Marks** of weakness, **marks** of woe"*

The first use of "mark" ("mark in every face I meet") means to notice someone - i.e "notice every face I meet". However, the next times that it is used is to replace the word "signs" - i.e "signs of weakness, signs of woe". The repetition could ALSO reflect the cyclical nature of suffering, but the changing meaning of the word **marks** could also signify the poet's frustration at the changing nature of London, due to the **Industrial Revolution** - again due to those in power.

### The use of the French Revolution:

> *"The hapless soldier's sign <br>
> Runs in blood down palace walls."*

This message alludes to the recently occurred *French Revolution*, in which those in poverty rebelled against the monarchy due to their lack of interventionin the collapsing economy.

The Revolution was inspired by **The Enlightenment**, but the Revolution had much more bloodshed, hence "runs in blood down palace walls." The use of this in the poem suggests that the unhappiness of the British soldier could lead to an uprising similar to the French Revolution.

Overall, the language used in this poem clearly suggests that the poor suffer due to the *abuse of power by the **Government, the monarchy, the church, and rich landowners***.

The final line of the poem is:

> *the marriage hearse*.

This is an *oxymoron*: two words that contradict each other, as marriage is not typically associated with the same image of death that a hearse is. This oxymoron suggests that the glorious London of the past is to be destroyed by the present.
