# Remains - Poem

# Language:

## The title:

The title of "Remains" has a lot of **ambiguity** behind it: it could mean the soldier's uselessness now that the war is over, or the remains of the man shot by the soldier and his friends. This is the first part of the ambiguity of the poem that shows the complexities that goes through the poet's mind.

## The use of colloquialisms:

The narrator also tends to use a lot of colloquialisms and everyday language: for example, the looter **"legs it up the road"**  , and **"tosses"** the victim's body. This conveys the idea that this is an everyday occurrence for the soldiers, just another story to tell, another "occasion" as the beginning puts it.

This casual language does not remain though; as the soldier shoots the looter, **"every round rips through his life"**, a violent metaphor which is juxtaposed to the formerly used casual language - painting a strong picture of the effects of conflict before and after on the soldier.

## The use of vague language:

Armitage also uses vague language, which reflects the *indescribable horror of war (can be compared to "Bayonet Charge")*. This can be seen in the description of the looter's body, being **"on the ground, sort of inside out"**. The use of **"sort of"** is vague language, reflecting the impossibility that is describing what the horror of war is.

> *This suggests that, despite the man's arduous military training, he is not prepared for the harsh reality that is killing someone.* 

## The description of the aftermath of killing the looter:

>*One of my mates goes by* 
>*and tosses his guts back into his body.* 
>*Then he's carted off in the back of a lorry.*

The treatment of the now dead looter is very disrespectful, conveyed by the verb "tossing", as this creates an image of the once living person as a **piece of trash.**. In addition, these words create the image of these soldiers as bin-men, further reflecting this idea. This treatment of the man leaves an impact on the man.

## The lasting effects on the narrator:

After the war has concluded, the narrator turns to **substance abuse**, but it is clearly *not working -* **"the drink and drugs won't flush him out."** The "him" is clearly the looter, but the verb "flush" creates an image in the reader's mind, as if he was flushing out a disease. This suggests that the soldier is now unclean due to what he has done.

### The memory of the looter:

When describing the memory of the looter that "remains" in the soldiers head, he uses the war metaphor **"dug in behind enemy lines"**. This use of war imagery, while the poet is now at home conveys the impact that war has had on the narrator's psyche: **his way of thinking has adapted to the boundless amounts of conflict he has seen, showing how inescapable war is.**
