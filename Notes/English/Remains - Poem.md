# Remains - Poem

# Language:

## The title:

The title of "Remains" has a lot of **ambiguity** behind it: it could mean the soldier's uselessness now that the war is over, or the remains of the man shot by the soldier and his friends. This is the first part of the ambiguity of the poem that shows the complexities that goes through the poet's mind.

## The use of colloquialisms:

The narrator also tends to use a lot of colloquialisms and everyday language: for example, the looter **"legs it up the road"**  , and **"tosses"** the victim's body. This conveys the idea that this is an everyday occurrence for the soldiers, just another story to tell, another "occasion" as the beginning puts it.

This casual language does not remain though; as the soldier shoots the looter, **"every round rips through his life"**, a violent metaphor which is juxtaposed to the formerly used casual language - painting a strong picture of the effects of conflict before and after on the soldier.

## The use of vague language:
