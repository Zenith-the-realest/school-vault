# The Emigree - Poem

## What is an "emigree"?

An emigree (which is the feminine form of **emigrant**) is a woman forced to leave her native country, usually for *political reasons.* The conflict presented in the poem is an ***inner conflict,*** resulting for both her love for her homeland, and the necessity that leaving her homeland is; this conflict could be described as "**between heart and head"** her heart loves the place, but her head knows it is too dangerous.

>*As a power poem, this poem can be a **exploration of how we choose what is bestowed power.*** 

# Structure:

The structure of the poem is **chaotic: There is no rhyme or regular rhythm, and enjambment is also used.** 

>*There once was a country... I left it as a child* 
>*but my memory of it is sunlight-clear* 
>*for it seems I never saw it in that November* 
>*which, I am told, comes to the mildest city.* 

The sentences here continue onto separate lines; as well as enjabment, there is also caesura in "*There once was a country **...** I left it is as a child*" This *slows down the pace of the poem,* which forces the reader to stop and think.

>The chaotic structure of the poem reflects the chaos of the plce the emigree loves, and the ***lack of power she has*** in not being able to go there.

## Stanza length:

However, the stanza length can be referred to as a structure; it usually follows **8 stanzas,** showing how the poet tries to enforce order on what she experienced. However, the last stanza is 9, showing how her *lack of power* in letting her memories go. 

## Caesura in the final stanza:

>*My city takes me dancing through the city*
>*of walls. They accuse me of absence, they circle me.* 
>*They accuse me of absence, they circle me.* 
>*They accuse me of being dark in their free city.* 
>*My city hides behind me. They mutter death,* 
>*and my shadow falls as evidence of sunlight.*
