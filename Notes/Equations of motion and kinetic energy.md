# Equations of motion and kinetic energy

# What is an equation of motion?

An equation of motion are equations that **include *velocities, acceleration, distance and time for objects that have constant acceleration*** The equation below is an example:

(final velocity  - initial velocity)^2 = 2 x acceleration x distance

>For the above equation, displacement is usually used instead of distance.

# How do you calculate kinetic energy?

Kinetic energy can be calculated with

KE = (1/2) x mass x speed^2
