# Nazi consolidation of power,1933-4

# How did Hitler become chancellor?

- Nazi party increased share of votes in **July 1932 elections,** winning *230 seats.*
- However, it seemed to be getting worse for the Nazis - in **November 1932 elections,** they lost *38 seats.* 
- In **December 1932,** Hindenburg chose *von Schleicher* to be chancellor, but he was forced to resign within a month. This meant that Hindenburg effectively ruled **with the support of army leaders and industrialists.** 
- Hitler was able to strike a deal with a politician known as **Franz von Papen,** in the case that von Papen would be made **vice-chancellor** if he could persuade Hindenburg to make Hitler **chancellor.** 
- Hindenburg agreed due to Hitler's **popularity,** and both von Papen and Hindenburg thought they could control Hitler. Hitler was made **chancellor of Germany on *30 January 1932.***
