# Nazi consolidation of power, 1933-4

# How did Hitler become chancellor?

- Nazi party increased share of votes in **July 1932 elections,** winning *230 seats.*
	- However, it seemed to be getting worse for the Nazis - in **November 1932 elections,** they lost *38 seats.* 
- In **December 1932,** Hindenburg chose *von Schleicher* to be chancellor, but he was forced to resign within a month. This meant that Hindenburg effectively ruled **with the support of army leaders and industrialists.** 
- Hitler was able to strike a deal with a politician known as **Franz von Papen,** in the case that von Papen would be made **vice-chancellor** if he could persuade Hindenburg to make Hitler **chancellor.** 
- Hindenburg agreed due to Hitler's **popularity,** and both von Papen and Hindenburg thought they could control Hitler. Hitler was made **chancellor of Germany on *30 January 1932.*** 

# What was the **Reichstag Fire,** and how did the Nazis use it?

- In the **1933 elections, Nazis controlled the media and *banned opposition meetings.*** The ***SA was also used to terrorise opponents.*** 

On **27 February 1933,** the **Reichstag caught fire.** A Dutch communist known as **Marinus van der Lubbe** was blamed for this, and Hitler used this to stir up anti-Communist feelings in Germany.

- As a result of this, Hitler persuaded Hindenburg to pass the **Emergency Decree,** removing *people's civil rights,* and allowing Hitler to throw **thousands of Communist supporters into prison.** 

- Elections took place on **5 March 1933,** and Nazis hoped they'd win enough seats for a **majority.** However, this didn't happen, as they only won **288 seats.**
    - As a result of this, Hitler had to make a **coalition with the *Nationalist Party* to have a majority**, and subsequently ***banned*** the Communist Party.

> The Reichstag Fire was used to remove Communists from the electorate.

# What was the **Enabling Act?** 

- The Enabling Act was passed on **24 March 1933,** and allowed Hitler to pass laws for the next four years **without the support of the Reichstag.** This made him a **legal dictator.** 

Using the Enabling Act, he:

- Banned trade unions, making all German workers become part of the **German Labour Front (DAF)** 
- Outlawed all other political parties, making Germany a **one-party state.** 

> Hitler used the Enabling Act to pass laws without the support of the Reichstag.
# What was the **Night of the Long Knives?** 

Even though the SA had **helped Hitler come to power,** Hitler saw them as a potential threat. He believed **Ernst Röhm,** the leader of the SA, was becoming *too powerful.* 

The army were ***also suspicious of them,*** and Hitler knew he needed the *support of the army to remain in power.* As a result, on the weekend of **29-30 June 1934,** SS assassination squads **murdered Hitler's potential SA rivals, including *Röhm.*** 

As a result of this, the **SA became subordinate to the SS,** with many of its members being absorbed into the SS and army.
    - Hitler declared his actions legal, as he argued that the assassinated were **planning to overthrow the government.** 

The Night of the Long Knives was a **triumph for Hitler,** as he got rid of opposition, and was a display of Nazi ruthlessness.

> Hitler was successfully able to remove threats to his power via the Night of the Long Knives.

# What did the death of Hindenburg lead to?

After Hindenburg died in **August 1934,** Hitler used his death to ***combine the posts of chancellor and president,*** calling himself "**der Führer (the leader)**" of Germany.

- Additionally, he made himself **commander-in-chief of the army.** He used this position to have the armed forces members swear an ***oath of allegiance*** to Hitler, vowing to obey and give their lives for him.

> Hindenburg's death led to the **death of the Weimar Republic,** making Germany a ***dictatorship.***
