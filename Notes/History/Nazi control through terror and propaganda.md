# Nazi control through terror and propaganda

# What did the Nazis do once in power?

The Enabling Act meant the government could **read people's post, listen to conversations, and search homes *without notice.*** Germany became a **police state,** as the police would supervise and **restrict** activities of the Germans.

- Top jobs were given to the **high-ranking Nazis, and the** non-Nazi supporters were **sacked.** 
- In 1934, the **Law for the Reconstruction for the Reich was passed -** this law allowed Nazis total power over local government.
    - This included the legal system, which made all judges Nazis, and **removed trial by jury.** 
- In march 1934, the **SD (Nazi intelligence service)** was set up under **Reinhard Heydrich**, that aimed to ***spy on all Germans.***

> Once the Nazis got into power, they made Germany into a **police state.** 

# How did Nazis use terror?

The SS was expanded under **Himmler** in the 1930s, completely loyal to Hitler, and **struck fear into German people.** 
- The first **concentration camps were set up after 1933,** intended for *political prisoners.* 
- The **Gestapo** (secret police) were also feared.
    - People were encouraged to report anyone they **believed was anti-Nazi** to the Gestapo.
- The Gestapo were also **aided by local wardens,** who ensured Germans were loyal to the regime.

As a result, most Germans accepted the new regime - either due to **fear** or **agreement** with the Nazis.

> The Nazis used terror to get the German people to conform.

# Who was the **Minister of Propaganda,** and what did he do?

- The Minister of Propaganda was **Josef Goebbels,** and promoted many Nazi ideas.
    - One of these was the perpetuation of the **"Hitler myth,"** which portrayed Hitler as the saviour of Germany.
- There were also other events, such as the **Nuremberg Rallies,** which showcased a *dedication to the cause.*
