# Nazis during Weimar "Golden Years" and Depression

## How were the years 1924-9 perceived?

The years 1924-9 were perceived as the **Golden Years** of the Weimar Republic. This was because:

- **1919-23 were traumatic years for Germany, with a series of economic and political crises.** 

*Gustav Stresemann* became Chancellor in ***August 1923.*** His leadership made Weimar Republic more stable.

## Positive and negative aspects economically, culturally and politically:

## How known were the Nazis?

- In 1919, **Anton Drexler** founded the *German Workers' Party,* and by **1921,** Hitler became its leader.
- Hitler put out the "**Twenty-Five Point Programme,**" which set out the policies of the party, stressing **the superiority of the German people,** and promoting *anti-Semitism.* 
- The Munich Putsch in **November 1923** was Hitler's attempt to seize power, inspired by those like Mussolini. This failed, and he was **sent to prison.** 
- In prison, Hitler wrote ***Mein Kampf (My Struggle)***, which set out his beliefs, such as **lebensraum,** (living space) and that *Aryans (white Europeans)* were the **"master-race".**
- Hitler realised that Nazis would have to come to power **democratically, as opposed to forcibly.** 
    - However, they still failed, only gaining **12 seats in the Reichstag.** The anti-Semitic policies did appeal to some poeple, but failed to win the majority.

> Overall, the Nazis became **well known,** but **not successful in elections.** 

# What was the Wall Street crash, and what did it lead to?

- The Wall Street Crash was a major American stock market crash that led to economic depression worldwide.
- Due to the Crash, US banks **called back their loans.** 
    - This led to mass bankruptcy, and industrial production **declined.** 
- Unemployment rose, as in **October 1929, only *1.6 million* were unemployed,** but by **February 1932, this number rose to *6 million.*** 

> The Wall Street crash was a major stock market crash, which led to a **Depression** in Germany.

# What did economic depression lead to?

- Weimar politicians seemed **unable, or unwilling to deal with the problems.** 
- Heinrich Brüning, who was **Chancellor from March 1930,** had *cut salaries and social benefits, and **raised taxes.** *
    - This made him unpopular with the Reichstag, so Brüning had to use **Article 48,** which allowed him to make *decisions **without** parliamentary support.* 
- Because Germany did not function as a democracy, citizens turned to more **extremist parties,** and caused the **Nazi party to *grow in popularity.***
    - By **November 1932,** it was the **largest party in the Reichstag.** 
        - This increase is further emphasised by the fact that in the 1929 elections, their vote was **3%,** but in November 1932, their vote was **33%.** 

> The economic depression led to a **political crisis in the Weimar Republic,** and **increased** Nazi popularity.

# How did the Nazi party appeal to voters?

- Hitler promised to make **Germany great again**: appealed to **young and unemployed**.
- Businessmen believed Nazis would **improve economy** (or encourage people to spend on goods)
- Industrialists / bankers liked their **anti-Communist** beliefs.
- Farmers believed that Nazis improving the economy would benefit them, as people would buy **more of their food.** 
- Hitler was **impressive and charismatic.**
- **"Negative cohesion:"** People shared the **fears of the Nazis** over their **beliefs.** 
- Weimar democracy **failed to address Germany's economic problems** 
- **Effective use of propaganda**
- Nazi propaganda portrayed Hitler as the **savior of Germany.** 
- **Generalised slogans** made it hard for criticism of their policies.
- SA gave promise of law and order, as there was **violence on the streets which scared people.** 

> Overall, the Nazis used a mixture of propaganda, effective policies and economic pushes to gain support.
