# Nazi consolidation of power, 1933-4

# How did Hitler become chancellor?

## Timeline:

- Nazi party increase votes in July 1932, winning 230 seats. However, Hindenburg did not make Hitler chancellor due to him being **suspicious.** 
- It got worse for the Nazis - in November 1932, they lost **38 seats.** 
- In December 1932, Hindenburg chose ***von Schleicher*** as chancellor, but **he was forced to resign after a month.** This meant that Hindeburg effectively ruled without **army leader and industrial support.**
