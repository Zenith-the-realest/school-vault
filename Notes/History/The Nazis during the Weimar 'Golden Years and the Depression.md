# Nazi consolidation of power, 1933-4

# How did Hitler become chancellor?

## Timeline:

- Nazi party increase votes in July 1932, winning 230 seats. However, Hindenburg did not make Hitler chancellor due to him being **suspicious.** 
- It got worse for the Nazis - in November 1932, they lost **38 seats.** 
- In December 1932, Hindenburg chose ***von Schleicher*** as chancellor, but **he was forced to resign after a month.** This meant that Hindenburg effectively ruled without **army leader and industrial support.**
- Hitler then made a deal with **Franz von Papen,** another politician, which stated that he would make **von Papen vice chancellor** if he was able to convince Hindenburg to make Hitler chancellor.
- Hindenburg agreed, as Hitler was popular. Both von Papen and Hindeburg thought they could ***control Hitler.*** Hitler was made **chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.** 

> Hitler became chancellor through **electoral support and political dealings.** 

# What was the Reichstag Fire, and how did the Nazis use it?

- In the 1933 elections, Nazis **controlled the media, and *banned any opposition meetings.*** 

On ***27 January 1933,*** the **Reichstag caught fire.** A Dutch Communist name **Marinus van der Lubbe** was blamed for this, and Hitler exploited this to stir up anti-Communism in Germany.

- As a result, Hitler persuaded Hindenburg to pass the **Emergency Decree,** which *removed people's civil rights,* and allowed Hitler to throw Communist supporters into prison.
