# Interpreting Client Briefs

A **written** client brief may need interpretation – it may have some ambiguities within them, as it may not be explicitly stated that "the theme of the product is", for example.

In this case, you will need to carefully read over a client brief:

### Example:

>[!example] 
>*Inner Fortress* is a new console game aimed at teenagers that will be released in August.
>We require a 30-second teaser of the new game to build suspense ahead of its launch. The video will need to include live action from the game itself as well as several shots of the main character, Zeb.
>
>The action gamees teaser video will need an upbeat backing track playing throughout and the release date should be the last thing viewers see.
>
>The 30 second video will need to be with us in the month before the game's release to allow enough time for online promotion.

From this we can gather the:

- **Audience:** The client notes the game is *aimed* at teenagers.
- **Type of Product:** The client wants a *30-second video.*
- **Purpose:** The video is designed to *promote* a new game.
- **Content:** The client is specific about what the video should include
- **Genre:** The game's genre is *action* – the teaser must reflect that.
- **Timescales:** The game's *release* and *deadline* (July) are included.
- **Content:** The client is specific about what must be in the video.
