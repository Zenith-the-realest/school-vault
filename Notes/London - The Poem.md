# London - The Poem

## Structure:

The poem has a **repetitive structure**: it is written in quatrains (each stanza using 4 lines), with an **ABAB** rhyme scheme. There is a heavy emphasis on **repetition**, which reflects the *relentless, repetitive and overwhelming suffering in the city.*

The repetition also emphasises that the life of suffering is *inescapable*: no one will be able toe scape it, as it is there due to the decisions of people in power.

> The structure of the whole text also matters; the first two stanzas *focus on the sufferers*, whereas stanza three focuses on the *causes*, and then the final stanza focuses on the  *sufferers again*  Yet again, it is cyclical - further emphasising the inescapable fate of the people in the city.
