# Newton's Second Law

# When a resultant force is not zero, what happens?

When a resultant force is more or less than zero, the **speed or direction (or both)** of an object can change.

# What is Newton's Second Law?

Newton's second law is **force = mass x acceleration,** showing that the resultant force is dependent of the mass and rate of change of speed
