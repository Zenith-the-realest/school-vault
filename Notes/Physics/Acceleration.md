# Acceleration

# What is acceleration?

Acceleration is the **rate of change of velocity (velocity change per second,)** as velocity is the **rate of change of displacement** (speed is therefore the rate of change of distance.) Because acceleration is a rate, its calculation will involve a *division by time, being:* 

Acceleration = change in velocity / time
or
Acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time

## What is the difference between positive and negative acceleration?

As *negative or positive velocity indicate a **backward or forward movement in direction,***, positive and negative acceleration **indicates speeding up or slowing down.**
