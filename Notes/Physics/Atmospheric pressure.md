# Atmospheric pressure

# What is the atmosphere?

The atmosphere is a *single layer of gas* that **protects the Earth.** Its thickness is ver small compared to the diameter of the Earth. It covers the Earth to a height of **700km**.

## What is atmospheric pressure?

Atmospheric pressure is pressure exerted on us by the ***gases of the atmosphere.*** On the Earth, it is **101,325 Pa,** or approximately **100,000 Pa / 100,000 kPa.**

>You can see the effects of atmospheric pressure by using a **can.** When the can is open, the **forces of the can due to pressure** are *equal* in all directions. However, if the air is sucked out of the can, the can **collapses into itself**.
