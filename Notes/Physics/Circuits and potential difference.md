# Circuits and potential difference

# What is potential difference?

In batteries / cells, there are substances that react to separate charges, making one side of the battery **positive, and the other negative.** The positive terminal has a **higher electrical potential than the negative, thus there is a *potential difference***.

- On the circuit symbol for a cell, the **longer side is** positive, and the **shorter side is** negative.

## What happens when you apply voltage to a wire?

When voltage (another word for **potential difference**) is applied between the ends of a wire, an *electric field* is set up in the wire.

# What is the equation that links **potential difference, energy and charge?**  

The equation

**energy transferred (J)** = **potential difference (V)** x **charge (C)** 

## How is voltage measured?

Voltage is measured with a **voltmeter.**
