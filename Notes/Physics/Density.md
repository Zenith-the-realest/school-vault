# Density and conservation of mass

## What is density?

Density tells you **how much mass there is per volume.** An object can have the *same volume* but *different masses*, because they have **different densities.** 
If you have two different sized objects that are made of the *same material,* it will have the same density, because it is a property of a **material, not an *object*** 

## How does one calculate density?

Density is calculated by the equation $$Density=\frac{mass(kg)}{volume(m^3)}$$.

>For example, a material that has a mass of **3.6kg** and a volume of **300m^3**, will have a density of 3.6/300 kg/m^3, or 0.012.

## How does the state of a substance affects its density?

A *solid* is more dense than a **liquid or gas.** This can be seen in the particle model: a solid has more particles per unit of volume than a liquid or gas, hence it has a higher density. However, there is one exception to this rule, which is H2O, or water, which is less dense as ice (solid) than it is in liquid form (water).

## What is conservation of mass?

The law of conservation of mass states that **mass cannot be created or destroyed, and that particles do not *appear or dissappear.***

>For example, melting 1g of ice gives you **1g of water.**
