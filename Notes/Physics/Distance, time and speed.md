# Distance, time and speed

# How is distance and time measured in a lab?

# Trolley moving down a ramp:

Measure the distance using a **ruler,** and use a stopwatch or **light gates** to measure the time.

## Falling object:

Measure distance with a ruler, and use **light gates** to measure time.

## What are the issues with stopwatches?

There can sometimes be a measurement issue with stopwatches when it comes to measuring long or short distances. This is because there is a **reaction time** that can affect *accuracy or precision of your measurement*.

## How can this issue be avoided?
Using **light gates** can bypass this issue, the timer is independent of the person doing the experiment - the timer starts and stops when an object interrupts a light beam.

## What are alternatives to light gates?

**Ultrasound** can also be used - the device measures the time taken for a pulse to travel there and back. It uses this value and the **the speed of the pulse** to work out distance. 

# How is speed calculated?

In **uniform motion, speed doesn't change.** The equation below is used for uniform motion:

speed = distance / time

Motion where speed is not constant is called **non-uniform motion.** For example, running 100m in 10 seconds at non-uniform motion, your **average speed = 10m/s,** but you don't travel at 10m/s for the whole race - it is only an *average.*
