# Distance-time graphs

# What is a graph of distance against time?

A graph of distance against time tells you the **distance an object travels in a given time.** Following graph rules, the *gradient of a distance-time graph* is **speed.** This is because gradient is (change in y)/(change in x), which is, in this case, **distance / time,** the equation for speed.

# What do lines tell you in a distance time graph?

- A straight (non-horizontal) line means the object's speed is constant
- A horizontal line means the object is at rest
- The steeper it is, the faster the object moves.

# What is a displacement-time graph, and how is it different?

A distance-time graph tells you total distance travelled. However, a displacement-time graph tells you **distance from a point.** And because displacement is a vector, the *gradient of a displacement-time graph can be **negative,*** because it has a direction.
