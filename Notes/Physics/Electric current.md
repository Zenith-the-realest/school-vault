# Electric current

# What is current?

Current is defined as the **rate of flow of charged particles (or *charge*)**. In the metal wires used to make circuits, the charges that move are **electrons.** Although each of them have very small charges, there are *lots of them,* so it adds up.

- To create a current you need a **cell or a battery (a collection of cells)**, and a **complete circuit.**
    - The current everywhere in a **single loop** is the same.

## Which way does current flow?

When the direction of electric current is drawn on a circuit diagram, it is drawn in the direction from the **positive terminal** of the battery to the **negative terminal** of the battery, as opposed to the actual electron flow from **negative to positive.** This is called *conventional current.* 

# How do you calculate with current?

Current can be calculated with the equation

**Charge flow (C)** = **current (A)** x **time (s)** 

Charge (symbol **Q**) is measured in **C**oulombs, current (symbol **I**) is measured in **A**mperes, and time (symbol lower-case t) measured in **s**econds.
