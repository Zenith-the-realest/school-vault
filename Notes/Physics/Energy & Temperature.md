# Energy & Temperature

# What is temperature?

Temperature tells you **how hot or cold something is.** It can be measured using a *thermometer or temperature sensor.* The units of temperature are degrees Celsius (°C), or Kelvin (K). The conversion rates are below:

>-273°C = 0K, and 0°C is 273K.

## What is the difference between energy and temperature?


- The energy in a thermal store is measured in **joules (J).** It depends on *the arrangement and speed of movement / vibration* of the particles.
- Temperature tells you the average kinetic energy of the particles.

# What happens when things are heated up?

Heating can:

- change the energy stored in the system to change the temperature
- cause a change in state
- make chemical reactions occur.

Changes of state are **physical changes,** which are reversible, because the particles are *simply rearranged.* 

>This means that *dissolving* is also a **physical change** 

The opposite of a physical change is a **chemical change**. These are different because chemical changes are **irreversible / hard to reverse,** as the *chemical structure of the object is changed.* An example is **burning wood.**
