# Everyday forces and their effects

# How do you explain the motion of falling objects?

As an example, I will use **jumping out of a plane.** When you jump out, you accelerate, and your motion changes because there is a resultant force on you; although the air exerts a force on you, the **Earth exerts a larger force on you.** This pulls you towards the Earth, and as *acceleration increases,* eventually the force of the air (which increases as acceleration increases) will be equal to the force of the Earth, and so your motion ***no longer changes.*** This stage is called *terminal velocity.* 

# How do you explain the motion of rockets?

When a rocket takes off, there is a resultant force that produces *acceleration.* This is caused by the burning fuel, which pushes gas out of the bottom of the rocket. The gas pushing on the rocket and the rocket pushing on the gases is another example of Newton's Third Law.

When the force of the gas on the rocket is bigger than the rocket's force on the Earth, the rocket will accelerate.
