# Floating and sinking

## Why does a floating object float?

A floating object floats because there is a **upwards force** on the object called *upthrust.* This can be seen in when one floats in a swimming pool. You are in contact with both the water and the air, but the water **exerts a bigger upwards force on you** than the *downwards force exerted by the air.* This is why you float.

# Why do different objects float and sink?

Submarines "float" at different depths in the ocean, because if the **pressure difference** along with the **area** is big enough, the net force can *balance its weight.* 

For the submarine to sink, the weight needs to be **increased.** Submarines have tanks of air, so when you let water into the tanks, the weight increases, and the upthrust is not enough to balance it, so the submarine sinks.

However, to return to the surface, the submarine has **tanks of compressed air,** which can be pumped back into the now **filled tanks of water,** to allow it to lose weight and return to the surface.

>Fish also do this using their **swim bladder,** which they can vary the amount of gas which it holds.
