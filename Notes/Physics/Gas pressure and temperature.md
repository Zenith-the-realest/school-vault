# Gas pressure and temperature


# Why do gases exert pressure?

Gases exert pressure because the gas particles **collide with the walls of the container.** This exerts pressure because these collisions *create a force*. If more particles are added to an inexpansible container, the **pressure increases.** 


# How does temperature affect gas pressure?

If the temperature of a gas is high, the *energy of their particles* increase, and therefore their speed will be high. This means that there will be *more collisions* the *higher the temperature*, and therefore a higher temperature leads to a higher pressure.

## How does one measure pressure?

The pressure of air trapped in a bottle can be measured using a **pressure gauge.** The unit that is used to measure pressure is called the **Pascal (Pa)**. There is also the **kilopascal (kPa),** which measures at 1000Pa.

# What is the relationship between (pressure and volume), and temperature?

The graphs of pressure against temperature and volume against temperature show that they are proportional. This means that as one is increased, the other one is increased. It can be seen in the graph that at ***273.14Â°C,*** pressure and volume are at zero. This temperature is called **absolute zero,** and it is the temperature where particles cease to move.
