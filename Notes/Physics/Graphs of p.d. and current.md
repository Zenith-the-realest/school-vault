# Graphs of p.d and current

# How do you get measurements for the **graphs of p.d and current?**

- Graphs of p.d. and current are called **characteristic graphs.** Data is collected by measuring the current flowing at **different potential differences.** 

## What can you do with these measurements?

You can:

- Plot a "**characteristic graph**" (graph of p.d. and current)
- You can calculate resistance from each pair of measurements..

# **Characteristic graphs:** 

## Resistor:

The characteristic graph for a resistor is a **straight line.** This is because it is a fixed resistor, meaning that, following **Ohm's Law,** the resistance must always equal the same thing in every pair.

## Lamp:

For a lamp, it is similar to an **S shape.** This is because Ohm's Law only applies when **temperature *doesn't change***.

> Temperature changes due to the electrons flowing in the wire **colliding with the ions in the wire, which vibrate more as the wire gets hotter.**
> This makes the current *increase* along with potential difference, but p.d. increases at a slower rate.

## Diode:

Diodes are components that **only let current flow one way.** This is reflected in its characteristic graph, due to the fact that initially, while **potential difference is negative, there is no current**, until it is positive, at which point the **current suddenly increases.**
