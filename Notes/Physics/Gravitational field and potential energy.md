# Gravitational field and potential energy

# What is a **gravitational field?** 

A **gravitational field** is a region where a *mass* experiences an *attractive force.* The calculation to calculate the force of gravity is:

**gravity force** = **mass** x **gravitational field strength** 

## What is gravitational field strength?

**Gravitational field strength** is a measure of the *force on a 1kg mass when it is in a gravitational field* due to *another mass.* The **mass does not change,** but the force of the mass depends on the **field**. 

### What affects the force of a **gravitational field?** 

A gravitational field's force increases if:

- The mass of one (or both) are **bigger.** 
- The distance is **smaller.** 

# What is **weight?** 

**Weight** is the *force of the Earth on an object.* Weight can be measured using **scales,** or a **newtonmeter.** The equation to calculate weight is:

**weight** = **mass** x **gravitational field strength**

>On Earth, the gravitational field strength $g$ can be regarded as **10N/kg.**
