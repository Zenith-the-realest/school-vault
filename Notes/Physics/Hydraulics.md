# Hydraulics

# How does **pressure in a fluid** cause a force?

Pressure in a fluid causes a force, because the **particles of the liquid *act in all directions.*** 
Pressure can be calculated via

**Pressure** = force / area

# What is a **hydraulic machine?** 

A hydraulic machine is a machine that **uses liquid to transmit a force.** The most simple hydraulic machines is made of **two pistons connected by a *pipe***.

## How do hydraulic machines **transmit forces?** 

When you push on one of the pistons of the hydraulic machine, the **pressure is *transmittted* through the liquid** and the other piston moves.
