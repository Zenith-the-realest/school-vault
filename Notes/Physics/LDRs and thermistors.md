# LDRs and thermistors

# What is a **thermistor?** 

A thermistor is a component whose resistance changes with **temperature.** They can come in different shapes and sizes.

## How does the resistance of a thermistor **change with temperature?** 

If you place a thermistor in cold water, initially, the **resistance will be high.** However, as the water heats up, the **resistance decreases.**

> This means that **as the temperature of a thermistor increases, the resistance *decreases.*** 

# What is an **LDR?** 

An LDR is a resistor whose resistance changes with **light intensity,** and also come in different shapes and sizes.

## How does the resistance of an LDR **change with light intensity?** 

As light intensity **increases**, the resistance of an LDR ***decreases.***
