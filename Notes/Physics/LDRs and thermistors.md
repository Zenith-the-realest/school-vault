# LDRs and thermistors

# What is a **thermistor?** 

A thermistor is a component whose resistance changes with **temperature.** They can come in different shapes and sizes?

## How does the resistance of a thermistor **change with temperature?** 

If you place a thermistor in cold water, initially, the **resistance will be high.** However, as the water heats up, the **resistance decreases.**

> This means that **as the temperature of a thermistor increases, the resistance *decreases.***
