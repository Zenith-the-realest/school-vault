# Liquid Pressure


# What is liquid pressure?

Liquid pressure is pressure exerted by liquid particles - these particles collide with **each other, *the container*, and anything in the water.** Liquid pressure acts in all directions.

## What happens to liquid pressure as you get deeper?

As you get deeper (in a swimming pool for example,) there is a *higher pressure on your eardrums.* This can also be seen by poking holes in a water bottle at different heights - the water at the lower depth will shoot farther horizontally. This is because the **molecules in any layer of the liquid** are *compressed by* the weight of all the liquid above it, pushing the molecules together so the ***pressure is bigger.***

## Pressure in liquids of different densities:

When two liquids with different densities are compared, the pressure at a specific depth is **greater** in the denser liquid, as in the denser liquidm there is a greater weight of liquid pushing down on it.

# How do you calculate liquid pressure?

Liquid pressure is calculated by:

pressure (Pa) = height of column (m) x density of liquid (kg/m^3) x gravitational field strength (N/kg)

The **difference in pressure between two different depths** can be calculated by finding the pressure at each depth, and subtracting the smaller pressure from the larger one.
