# Momentum


## What is momentum?

Momentum is a quantity that depends on the **mass and velocity** of an object. The equation for momentum is

momentum = mass x velocity.

# What is conservation of momentum?

Conservation of momentum dictates that **in any collision, momentum is *conserved***. The momentum before equals the momentum afterwards.

# What happens when objects collide?

There are two types of collision:

- Elastic collision: these do not transfer energy between each other - the energy in the object's kinetic stores stay the same
- Inelastic collision: some energy is transferred to other stores. For example, if two snooker balls were to collide, the energy would transfer via sound to a thermal store.
