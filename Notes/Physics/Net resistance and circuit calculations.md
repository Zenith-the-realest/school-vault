# Net resistance and circuit calculations

# What is **net resistacne?** 

Net resistance is the total resistance. If the components or their arrangements are changed, the net resistance changes.

> For example, imagine a lamp in the circuit. If another lamp is added in **series,** the current will *not change (current is always the same in a series circuit)* and the net resistance *increases.* 
> However, if you added another lamp in **parallel,** the total current *increases,* and the net resistance *decreases.* 
# How are series circuits analysed?

In series circuits:

- current is the same everywhere
- voltage across components add to voltage across the battery
- V = IR

This means that there are strategies that can be used to find resistance:

*If the p.d. is known across resistor and lamp, you can work out **current through resistor*** 
*If you know the current near the battery, you can work out **current through the lamp*** 
*If you know the p.d. across the lamp and the current, you can work out **resistance of the lamp***
