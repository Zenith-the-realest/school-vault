# Newton's First Law

Newton's First Law of Motion states:

*An object will continue to stay at rest or move with uniform velocity unless a force acts on it.* 

This means that it takes a resultant force (**i.e a total / net force**) to change the movement, direction, or both of an object.

# Why don't objects move at a steady speed in the real world?

Objects do not continue to move at a steady speed continuously in the real world, due to **friction.** Friction stops objects moving, because it is a force that acts on the object.

## What is equilibrium?

Equilibrium in a free body diagram is when the resultant force is zero, meaning the **motion doesn't change.**
