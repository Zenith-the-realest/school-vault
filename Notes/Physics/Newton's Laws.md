# Newton's Laws

# What causes forces?

Pairs of forces arise when objects interact in pairs:

- Each force acts on a *different object.* 
- The forces are the *same size and type (e.g **gravitational**)* 
- They act in *opposite directions.* 

The above is **Newton's Third Law,** also written as:
>"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

# What are non-contact forces?

Non-contact forces are objects that **interact *without* being in contact with each other.** Examples include:
- Electrostatics
- Magnetism
- Gravity

These forces are non-contact because they *interact at a distance.* Electric charges and magnets both **repel and attract,** but gravity **only attracts.** These forces are found in fields, which are *regions where electric charge, magnetic material or mass* **experiences a force.** 

## How are forces represented?

Forces are vector quantities, so they are represented using **force arrows.** 


# What are contact forces?

Contact forces, as opposed to non-contact forces, are forces that interact with contact. An example of this can be standing on a diving board - the board **pushes up on you.**
