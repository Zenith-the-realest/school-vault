# Pressure and volume

# How are pressure and volume related?

Pressure and volume are **inversely related.** This means that as one is increased, the other is halved.

- For example, if pressure is **doubled,** volume is **halved,** and *vice versa.* 

## Why is this the case?

This is the case because if the volume is halved, for example, there is **less room for the particles to collide** with each other **outside of the walls,** meaning that if the volume is halved, the collisions with the ***walls*** double, hence **doubling the pressure**.

### How do you calculate using pressure and volume?

The formula for pressure and volume (given that **temperature is constant**) is: $$P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$$

# How does **doing work** on a gas affect temperature?

>Saying that **"work is done"** or that you are **"doing work"** on something simply means that you are **transferring energy to it**.

Applying a force to a bike pump and moving it means that you are doing work on a gas increases its temperature, because transferring energy to it means that you **give energy to the particles,** enhancing their **kinetic energy**, making them move faster and therefore *collide more with the walls of the container.*
