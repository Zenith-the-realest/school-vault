# Resistance

# What does **current depend on?** 

Current depends on **potential difference,** and the **resistance** of the components. Resistance is measured in **ohms(Î©)**

Resistance is calculated via

**voltage / current = resistance**

The original equation, known as **Ohm's Law, is written as:** 

**voltage = current x resistance.**

## Why do some components have **changing resistances?** 

Metals are made of **positively charged ions** in a *regular pattern.* Ions are formed when electrons leave the outer shell of the atoms, and are **free to move through the structure of the metal.** 
Resistance is produced when these electrons **collide with the ions in the lattice.** This means that some components will change with an increase in current, as the flow of electrons increasing means that more will collide with the ions in the lattice.
