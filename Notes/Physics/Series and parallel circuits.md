# Series and parallel circuits

# **Series circuits:** 
## How is current measured in **series circuits?** 

Series circuits only have **one loop,** and the *current is the **same everywhere***. Current is measured with an **ammeter.** 

> The ammeter must be in **series** (in the loop), because the charge has to **flow through it to be measured.** 

## How is potential difference measured in **series circuits?** 

Potential difference is *shared between the components* in a **series circuit.** A **voltmeter** is used to measure potential difference. A voltmeter measures the 'rise in potential' across a cell or battery, or a 'drop in potential' across components.

# **Parallel circuits:** 

# How is current measured in **parallel circuits?** 

In parallel circuits, the **current at different points adds up to the current near the battery - each component has its own individual current.**

# How is potential difference measured in **parallel circuits?** 

The potential difference of every component in a parallel circuit is **the same.**
