# Simple machines

# What are **levers?** 

Levers are **force multipliers,** that transmit forces by *rotating about a pivot*.

## What are efforts and loads?

An effort is the **force you exert on the (lever for example,)** and the load is the **force the lever exerts**.

- If a pivot is close to the load, a **small effort** is required to lift it. Pushing down on a lever produces a turning force on the load, but *your hand moves further than the load.* 

## What is the **mechanical advantage?** 

The **mechanical advantage** is the ratio of **load to effort,** and can be calculated via:

mechanical advantage = load / effort

# How do **gears** transmit forces?

Gears are like levers, but instead they **rotate.** If a small cog rotates with a force, it will make a **larger cog rotate.** The larger cog will **exert a larger force,** but will not *move so far.*

- You can find the **mechanical advantage** by finding the ratio of the diameters of the cogs.
