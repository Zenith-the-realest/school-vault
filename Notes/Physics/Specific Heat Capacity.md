# Specific Heat Capacity

# What is specific heat capacity?

Specific heat capacity is **the energy required to change the temperature of *1kg* of a substance by *1°C.*** For example, concrete takes a 1/5th of the energy required to heat up water by 1°C. Specific heat capacity **depends on three things:** 
- The type of material
- The mass of material
- The temperature increase

# How do you calculate with specific heat capacity?

The equation for specific heat capacity is as follows:

change in thermal energy (J) = mass (kg) * specific heat capacity (J/kg°C) * change in temperature

or

E = mcΔt

# Why does specific heat capacity matter?

Specific heat capacity tells you **how resistant something is to *temperature change.***  This means that something like water, which has a **high resistance to temperature change**, is often used in central heating. Conversely, saucepans, which require a **low resistance to temperature change,** use less resistant materials.

>However, **cost** is also something that must be understood: metals like *gold and platinum* have low specific heat capacities, but are expensive. However, some metals are also ***poisonous.***
