# Specific Latent Heat:

# What happens when substances change state?

When substances change state, they either **take in or release** energy from the surroundings: For example, when water evaporates to form water vapour, the energy is transferred from the **thermal store** of the *surroundings* to the water. This also means that when water vapour condenses, the energy is transferred from the ***water to the surroundings.***
# Why does temperature not change while state changes?

Temperature does  not change while state changes, because the energy does not go into the **thermal store of the object,** but rather into ***breaking the bonds.*** The amount of energy required for this to change the state is called the **specific latent heat.** 

# What is specific latent heat?

There are two types of specific latent heat:
    - Specific latent heat of fusion (**solid → liquid or vice versa**)  
    - Specific latent heat of vaporisation (**liquid → gas or vice versa**)

## How do I calculate specific latent heat?

Specific latent heat is calculated via the equation:

**thermal energy for a change in state (J) = mass (kg) * specific latent heat (J/kg)**

or **E = ml**
