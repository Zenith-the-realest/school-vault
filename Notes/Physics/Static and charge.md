# Static and charge

# What is charge?

Charge is a **property of matter,** just like *mass.* Atoms are overall neutral, and this is because they have **equal amounts of protons and electrons.** Like charges *repel,* and unlike (opposite) *attract.* 

> *Electric shocks and lightning can be explained using the idea of charge.* 

# How is static electricity produced?

Static electricity can be produced by transferring electrons form **one insulator to another.** The positive charges cannot move because **they are in the nucleus,** but one object will end up with *more electrons than the other,* meaning one will have extra, and one will not have enough to cancel out the **positive charge from the electrons.** 

> The charge is what is called **"static electricity"** or **"static".**

## How do you **remove the charge** of an object?

To **remove charge from an object,** you need to connect it to something that **allows charge to flow,** such as a piece of metal - this is why people get **electric shocks.** 

- **Sparks** can also discharge charged objects, like a *Van der Graaf* generator, or clouds.
    - A spark is a **flow of charge (current)** through the *air.*
