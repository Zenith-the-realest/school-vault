# Stretching springs

# How do forces change shapes of objects?

Forces can *compress, stretch or bend* objects. You need *more than one force* for this to be done.

- Elastic objects are **able to return to their original shape** after the force acts on it.
- Plastic objects **remain deformed / distorted** after the force acts on it.

# What happens when a spring is stretched?

**Robert Hooke** was investigating what happens when he *stretched materials,* realising that springs were special.

A graph of **force against extension** of a spring is *linear* until a certain point - this point is known as the **limit of proportionality,** or the *elastic limit.* If you stretch a string to any point before this limit, it will *return ot its original length,* but above this, it will not - it is **permanently deformed.** 

## How do you calculate a **spring constant?** 

A spring constant is calculated via the formula:

**Force** exerted by a spring = **spring constant** x **extension** 

The gradient of the **linear section** of the graph is the *spring constant.* This tells you how *stiff* the spring is or **how difficult it is to stretch.**
