# The Particle Model

# Democritus and Leucippus:

A long time ago, people wondered what things were made of. Two greek philosophers, **Democritus and Leucippus,** thought that at some point, you would no longer be able to cut an object down, and they called this indivisible object an "atom", from the Greek *"atomos."*

>Because there was no *concrete evidence*, philosophers (what scientists were known as of the time) had a hard time believing in their existence.

# Dalton:

In the **1870s,** John Dalton was doing experiments to **measure how elements combined.** He believed his results were explainable if *everything was made of atoms.* 

## What was his atomic model?
>His atomic model was an ***indestructible sphere.***


## What were his propositions?

Dalton proposed that:
- All the atoms in one element are the **same**.
- All the atoms in one element are **different** from the atoms in ***all other elements.*** 

It took a long time for people to accept his ideas.

# JJ Thomson:

In **1897,** a scientist called **J.J Thomson** was investigating *rays given out by hot metals, but he was not **investigating atoms.***

## What did he discover?

He discovered that cathode rays were made of particles that had *less than **one-thousandth** the mass of a hydrogen atom.* He called this particle a **electron,** and because it was so small, it must have come from *within* an atom.
