# The Particle Model

# Democritus and Leucippus:

A long time ago, people wondered what things were made of. Two greek philosophers, **Democritus and Leucippus,** thought that at some point, you would no longer be able to cut an object down, and they called this indivisible object an "atom", from the Greek *"atomos."*

>Because there was no *concrete evidence*, philosophers (what scientists were known as of the time) had a hard time believing in their existence.

# Dalton:

In the **1870s,** John Dalton was doing experiments to **measure how elements combined.** He believed his results were explainable if *everything was made of atoms.* 

## What was his atomic model?
>His atomic model was an ***indestructible sphere.***


## What were his propositions?

Dalton proposed that:
- All the atoms in one element are the **same**.
- All the atoms in one element are **different** from the atoms in ***all other elements.*** 

It took a long time for people to accept his ideas.

# JJ Thomson:

In **1897,** a scientist called **J.J Thomson** was investigating *rays given out by hot metals, but he was not **investigating atoms.***

## What did he discover?

He discovered that cathode rays were made of particles that had *less than **one-thousandth** the mass of a hydrogen atom.* He called this particle an **electron,** and because it was so small, it must have come from *within* an atom. He also worked out the **charge of an electron is negative (-)**.

## What ideas did he have to make sense of?

He had to make sense of the ideas that:
    - An atom contains **negative** electrons.
    - Overall, atoms have **no** electrical charge. They are *neutral.* 
## What was his model of the atom?

In **1904,** Thomson suggested his new model, which he dubbed the **plum pudding model.** . He said that the atom consisted of a *positive mass,* with *negative electrons* embedded into them. The structure might be ***solid, or like a cloud.***  

# Ernest Rutherford:

In **1899,** Ernest Rutherford discovered that some materials emit particles, which he called *alpha particles*, which had a **positive charge.**  

## What did Rutherford do with his discovery?
He decided to conduct an experiment where he ***fired alpha particles at a piece of gold foil.***

### What were the results of this discovery?

The experiment resulted in most of the particles passing through, but some particles were **deflected,** and even fewer were ***reflected.*** This was an issue, because if the plum pudding model were to hold true, the particles would have passed right through.

## What was Rutherford's model?

As a result of his experiments, Rutherford proposed a new model:

>Rutherford's model, dubbed the *nuclear model*, suggested that an atom was made of a **tiny,positively charged nucleus** that had electrons orbiting around it.

Two things are made clear by this model:
    - The atom is **mostly empty space.**
    - Most of the mass of the atom is **concentrated in its nucleus.**
