# The Particle Model






# The Particle Model

# Democritus and Leucippus:

A long time ago, people wondered what things were made of. Two greek philosophers, **Democritus and Leucippus,** thought that at some point, you would no longer be able to cut an object down, and they called this indivisible object an "atom", from the Greek *"atomos."*

# Dalton:


In the **1870s,** John Dalton was doing experiments to **measure how elements combined.** He believed his results were explainable if *everything was made of atoms.* 

>His atomic model was an ***indestructible sphere.***

Dalton proposed that:
- All the atoms in one element are the **same**.
- All the atoms in one element are **different** from the atoms in ***all other elements.***
