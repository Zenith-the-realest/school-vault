# Turning forces

# How do forces cause rotation?

Forces produce rotation `y using **pivots**. The force that the pivot produces is called a *turning effect,* or *moment.* When the force is closer to the pivot, it is more diffcult to prodce a moment. Some forces produce **clockwise moments,** and some produce **anticlockwise moments.**
