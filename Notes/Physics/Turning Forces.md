# Turning forces

# How do forces cause rotation?

Forces produce rotation using **pivots**. The force that the pivot produces is called a *turning effect,* or *moment.* When the force is closer to the pivot, it is more diffcult to prodce a moment. Some forces produce **clockwise moments,** and some produce **anticlockwise moments.**

# How do you calculate a **moment** of a force?

The moment of a force can be calculated via the equation:

**moment** = **force** x **distance** 

This reflects how it is **more difficult** to produce a rotation from closer distances; the closer the distance, the smaller the moment.

# What is the principle of moments?

The **principle of moments** is the fact that *an object is balanced if **anticlockwise** and **clockwise moments** are equal.*
