# Vectors and scalars

## What is the difference between vectors and scalars?

- Vectors have **direction (e.g left and right)** and *magnitude (size)* 
- Scalars **don't have** direction but have *magnitude.* 

Examples of vectors and scalars (respectively) are:

- Velocity and speed
- Displacement and distance
- Forces and time

# What is the difference between **displacement and distance?**

Because distance is the full length travelled without regard for direction, that means displacement is **the full length travelled with respect to an originating point.** For example, if one travels 8m back and forth, the *distance travelled is 16m,* but the *displacement is 0, because they have returned to the original point.* 

# What is the difference between **speed and velocity?** 

Because speed is a scalar quantity, 1.5m/s (in speed) means that 1.5 meters are travelled every second in any direction. However, velocity is a vector, so 1.5m/s south is velocity as opposed to speed. 

>Velocities that are written **as negative** mean that it is going in the opposite direction.

# How are vector quantities added?

When adding vector quantities, their direction must be accounted for: For example *15m/s → + 15m/s ← = 0 meters travelled*, and *15m/s → + 30m/s ← = 15m/s.*
