# Velocity-time graphs

# What does a gradient of a graph against time tell you?

A graph against time's gradient will always tell you about a **rate of change with time.** This means that a graph of speed / velocity with time gives you **acceleration.** 

- A positive gradient means it is **speeding up.** 
- A negative gradient means the object is **slowing down.** 

# How do you get distance from a velocity / speed-time graph?

The area under the graph is speed (or velocity) multiplied by time. This means that the area below a speed-time graph gives you **distance,** as per the formula distance = speed x time (rearranged from **speed = distance / time** ).
