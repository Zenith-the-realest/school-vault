# Work and power


# What is work?

"Work" from a scientific sense is just the use of forces **transfer of energy.** You "do work" when lifting a book or a suitcase. The calculation for work is

Work done = force x distance


## What is the equivalent unit to work done?

Work done is measured in joules, but an equivalent unit is **newton-meters.** This is because it is force (N) x distance (m), multiplying together to make Nm, and therefore, 1J = 1 Nm.

# What is power?

Power is the **rate of energy transferred - analogous to the rate of work done.** 
Power is calculated using

Power = work done / time.
