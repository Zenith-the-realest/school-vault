# Research Data

Research used for a media product is either **primary** or **secondary.** However, data collected by these types of data can be categorised as *quantitative* or *qualitative*.

>**Quantitative data** – data that has a quantity attached to it, like closed surveys. They are easier to analyse and present in a graphical format, but not much thought / reason available from a responder.
>**Qualitative data** – Data that includes thoughts and opinions. Qualitative data is information tied to words, and therefore they are more difficult to analyse, but provide more detail than the former.
