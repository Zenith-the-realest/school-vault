>Magazines/Newspapers

## Advantages and Disadvantages


*Advantages* of secondary research are:

- The information can come from a **wide range of sources** – internet sites for example.

*Disadvantages* of secondary research are:

- The information may **not fully suit** the media project's requirements, as it was not generated for that purpose.
