# Sensing circuits

# How to measure temperature **with a circuit?** 

**Thermistors** can be used in sensing circuits to produce a **voltage that changes with temperature.** These are used in **heating or air conditioning, in** *houses, schools, or offices* for example.

> In sensing circuits (in this case a temperature sensor) there will be two resistors, one a fixed resistor, and one a thermistor. To the thermistor there is an attached voltmeter.
> This is because the output voltage depends on the **potential difference of the battery,** and the **magnitude of each resistor.** The voltage of the thermistor will depend on the temperature.

This can sense temperature because as **temperature increases, resistance decreases**. This means that when the temperature is higher, the resistance of the thermistor decreases.

- Following Ohm's Law, the fact that the resistance decreases means that there will be a decrease in voltage, because V = IR dictates that voltage depends on the current multiplied by **resistance, which the thermistor will decrease in in higher temperatures.** 

# How do LDR sensing circuits work?

They work similarly: there will be two resistors; one fixed, and one LDR. As light intensity increases, the voltage of the LDR will decrease due to the resistance of the LDR decreasing.
