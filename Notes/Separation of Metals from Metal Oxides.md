# Separation of Metals from Metal Oxides

> *Metals are usually found in **oxide form**, meaning we have to extract the metal from that*.
# What is oxidation and reduction?

Oxidation is defined as the **gain of oxygen,** and reduction the **loss of oxygen.** 

Examples:

Oxidation - $2Mg + O_2 \rightarrow 2MgO$
> Here, the magnesium has gained oxygen, therefore it is **oxidised.**
Reduction - $2MgO \rightarrow 2Mg + O_2$
> Here, the magnesium oxide has reduced to become magnesium + oxygen, and therefore it is **reduced.**
