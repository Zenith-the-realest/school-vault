# Stretching materials and storing energy

# How do you calculate the **energy transferred** in stretching a spring?

The energy transferred in stretching a spring is calculated via

**Energy** transferred in stretching = 0.5 x **spring constant** x **extension^2** 

# What happens when other materials are stretched?

## Rubber balloons:

As you blow up a balloon, it is at first difficult, as the **rubber is quite stiff.** At some point, it requires *less force to produce an extension,* but at the end, it is **finally stiff.**
