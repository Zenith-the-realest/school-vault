# The Emigree - Poem

## What is an "emigree"

An emigree (which is the feminine form of **emigrant**) is a woman forced to leave her native country, usually for *political reasons.* The conflict presented in the poem is an ***inner conflict,*** resulting for both her love for her homeland, and the necessity that leaving her homeland is; this conflict could be described as "**between heart and head"** her heart loves the place, but her head knows it is too dangerous.

>*As a power poem, this poem can be a **exploration of how we choose what is bestowed power.***
