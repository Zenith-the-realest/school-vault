# The Haber Process

# What is The Haber Process?

It is the **industrial production of ammonia using** *nitrogen and hydrogen.* 

The Equation for the Haber Process is as follows:

$N_2 + 3H_2 ⇌ $2NH_3$ *(+ heat)* 

## What are the conditions required for the Haber Process?

The Haber Process is done at a **temperature of 450°C, and a pressure of 200 atm(ospheres)** 

## Why is the Haber Process important?

It is important because it allows us to create the nitrogen-based fertilisers that let us grow food.

## How are the materials for the Haber Process acquired?

The Haber Process requires a lot of **nitrogen and hydrogen**, and they are acquired from:

- Nitrogen is acquired from the **air.** 
- Hydrogen is gained from breaking down hydrocarbons, such as **methane.** 

# What are important things about the reaction?

It is an **exothermic** reaction, and the two way reaction arrow means it is **reversible.** 

- This means that some of the ammonia made will reverse back to its nitrogen and hydrogen.

# How does the process work?

- Firstly, the hydrogen and nitrogen are fed into the **top left of the machine,** called the *reaction vessel.* 
    - In the vessel, temperatures are at **450°C, and the pressure at 200 atm(ospheres).** 
    - The gases are also free to pass over an **iron catalyst.** 
- Here, some of the nitrogen and hydrogen can react to form ammonia.
    - However, because it is a reversible reaction, some of the hydrogen and nitrogen still remain in their gaseous forms.
- This mixture of the nitrogen, hydrogen and ammonia is passed into a condenser, where the ammonia condenses into liquid ammonia.
        - However, the nitrogen and hydrogen do **not** condense, because they have *higher boiling points* than ammonia.
- The uncondensed nitrogen and hydrogen is then recycled back around to the reaction vessel, where the cycle repeats.
