# The Prelude - Context

## Who was William Wordsworth?

- William Wordsworth was born in **Cumberland, England, 1770.** He had a *troubled relationship* with his father, and was also hated by his grandparents and uncle from his mother's side.
- His parents both died before William reached his mid-teens, so he was insultingly sent to live with the family that hated him so much.
- Wordsworth then lived in **Penrith, in the Lake District**, spending most of his time outdoors to escape his disliked relatives.

## What was The Prelude intended to be?

The Prelude was intended to be the first part of a **three part epic poem** called *The Recluse*. Sadly, Wordsworth never managed to finish the poem, but the Prelude is almost **400 pages** in total. The format of the poem is so that it **firstly** explores Wordsworth's past, and then its *philosophical importance*, relating it to ***nature and wider society***.

>*Wordsworth himself described it as "**a poem on the growth of my own mind**"*
