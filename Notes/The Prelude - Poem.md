# The Prelude - Poem

# Form:


## Epic Poetry:

The poem is in the form of a **epic poem**. An epic poem usually tells a story about heroic actions (usually historic or legendary), based on a hero.

> *Examples include "Paradise Lost", a poem by John Milton that tells the story of Adam & Eve.* 

In epic poetry, there is one major event; in The Prelude, it is an entire **lifetime** of events, and the poem is seen as his **growth as a poet**. However, the events that occur in this play do not fit the idea of being "epic": however, when thought of as Wordsworth's awakening to nature's power, it is much more clear.

> *However, in epic poetry, there is always a **hero**, which would be the poet at first glance, but it is also arguable that **nature** itself is the hero of the poem.* 

## The use of blank verse:

Blank verse is when the poem has **no rhyme scheme**, but is written in **iambic pentameter**. This was popularised by the aforementioned Milton's Paradise Lost, and it became commonplace for poets of the time to use it - including Wordsworth.
