# The Prelude - Poem

# Form:

## Epic Poetry:

The poem is in the form of a **epic poem**. An epic poem usually tells a story about heroic actions (usually historic or legendary), based on a hero.

> *Examples include "Paradise Lost", a poem by John Milton that tells the story of Adam & Eve.* 

In epic poetry, there is one major event; in The Prelude, it is an entire **lifetime** of events, and the poem is seen as his **growth as a poet**. However, the events that occur in this play do not fit the idea of being "epic": however, when thought of as Wordsworth's awakening to nature's power, it is much more clear.

> *However, in epic poetry, there is always a **hero**, which would be the poet at first glance, but it is also arguable that **nature** itself is the hero of the poem.* 

## The use of blank verse:

Blank verse is when the poem has **no rhyme scheme**, but is written in **iambic pentameter**. This was popularised by the aforementioned Milton's Paradise Lost, and it became commonplace for poets of the time to use it - including Wordsworth.

# Structure:

The poem is **one long, sprawling verse**, for several reasons: For example, the reader having to read the sprawling verses has them **overwhelmed** by the intensity of the poem; similar to how Wordsworth as a young boy was overwhelmed by what he saw on the boat.

This use of a singular verse also creates a **conversational tone**, as if Wordsworth is trying to inform the reader of his revelatory experiences with nature. 


# Language:

In the poem, the speaker (Wordsworth as a boy), is convinced to steal the boat by a "her"; this "her" is **nature** itself. The feminine gender found in nature (along with other words like "boat", "cave", and "lake")contrasts the masculine words like "oars","line","ridge", and "peak". It is clear that the poet was not intending to steal a boat on his venture, but was **taken there by nature**.

>*One summer evening (led by her) I found*
>*A little boat tied to a willow tree* 

The enjambment of this sentence adds to how overwhelmed Wordsworth as a child was overwhelmed by nature.

>*Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in* 
>*Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth* 
>*And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice* 
>*Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;*

The boy unchaining the boat is described as an *act of stealth*. "Stealth" has a connotation of being sneaky and sly; the action is morally wrong, but the poet doesn't care. This means the first presentation of "man" is as selfish, as the boy takes a boat without forethought of the consequence. This pride is further exaggerated, as the child is said to be rowing whilst "*proud of his skill.* "

>*Leaving behind her still, on either side,*
>*Small circles glittering idly in the moon*,
>*Until they melted all into one track*
>*Of sparkling light.*

The poet describes the boat on the water - the imagery is *positive*, describing it as **"circles glittering"** and **"sparkling light"**  gives the water a magical, almost celestial quality. This positivity is **contrasted** in later lines. The present participles such as "stepping" and "leaving" build up to the most *positive point* of the poem, showing that there will later be a decline.

>But now, like one who rows,
Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point
With an unswerving line, I fixed my view
Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,
22
The horizonâ€™s utmost boundary; far above
Was nothing but the stars and the grey s
