# The Prelude - Poem

# Form:

## Epic Poetry:

The poem is in the form of a **epic poem**. An epic poem usually tells a story about heroic actions (usually historic or legendary), based on a hero.

The feminine gender found in nature (along with other words like "boat", c"cave", and "lake")contrasts the masucline words like "oars","line","ridge", and "peak". It is clear that the poet was
