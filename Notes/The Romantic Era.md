# The Romantic Era

## What was the Romantic Era?

During the Age of Enlightenment (an age driven by a mindset that favoured **science and reason** over **religion**), writers (such as <u>Shelley and Wordsworth</u>) would protest the present / future of mankind.
- They did this by using **old literary conventions**  and repurposing them.
These poems rejected institutions of power, and the poetry was used to spread **messages and political ideas.**
