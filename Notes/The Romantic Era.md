# The Romantic Era

## What was the Romantic Era?

During the Age of Enlightenment (an age driven by a mindset that favoured **science and reason** over **religion**), writers (such as <u>Shelley and Wordsworth</u>) would protest the present / future of mankind.
- They did this by using **old literary conventions**  and repurposing them.
These poems rejected institutions of power, and the poetry was used to spread **messages and political ideas.**

## What did Romantic writers do?

As mentioned before, Romantic writers repurposed old literary conventions. They also used a more **emotional and subjective view**, to protest the cold rationalism of Enlightenment.

They looked to the beauty of nature and past life to protest the changing world.
