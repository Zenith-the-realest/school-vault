# The Style, Content and Layout of a Product

The **purpose** of a media product has an influence on the final product in terms of **style**(colour scheme as an example). The below table explains this:

| **Key Decision**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Colour*                         | Colour scheme used varies depending on **purpose**; products that are made to educate will be bright because they intend to attract attention.       |
| *Conventions Of Genre*           | Genre relates to the **category** of a product – comedy or horror are examples. Posters promoting horror will look very different to comedy posters. |
| *Type Of Language Used*          | Language used in a product varies – Persuasive tones are used for *influencing* and *advertising*, whereas formal language is used for *informing*.  |
| *Position of Elements*           | Elements like text / images / videos are positioned based on the purpose. A poster used would have an image as the **main focus** of the product.    |
| *Style Of Audio Representation*  | Depends on purpose – Advertisements would use **loud audio** with **upbeat** music.                                                                  |
| *Style Of Visual Representation* | Overall appearance is based on the purpose – an informing product will be very formal and present information clearly.                               |
| *Tone Of Language*               | Tone of language determined by purpose – Tone would be **enthusiastic** for *advertising*, and **formal** for *educating.*                           |
