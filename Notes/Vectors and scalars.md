# Vectors and scalars

## What is the difference between vectors and scalars?

- Vectors have **direction (e.g left and right)** and *magnitude (size)* 
- Scalars **don't have** direction but have *magnitude.* 

Examples of vectors and scalars (respectively) are:

- Velocity and speed
- Displacement and distance
- Forces and time

# What is the difference between **displacement and distance?**

Because distance is the full length travelled without regard for direction, that means displacement is **the full length travelled with respect to an originating point.** For example, if one travels 8m back and forth, the *distance travelled is 16m,* but the *displacement is 0, because they have returned to the original point.*
