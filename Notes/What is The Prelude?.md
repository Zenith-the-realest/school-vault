# What is The Prelude?

## Summary

The extract of The Prelude studied is centered on Wordsworthâ€™s childhood memory in the Lake District, where he steals a boat and rows it into the middle of the lake. He sees a mountain, and it is bigger than he thought it was. After realising the monumental nature of the mountain, he hurries back to the shore, claiming the experience changed his perception of nature.

## Chain of events:

- He steals a boat rows out onto the lake.
	- Watches ripples as he easily rows, focusing on one point (the mountain).
- The mountain grows bigger than initially thought.
	- Because of this, he learns about the vastness of nature.
- He is scared and returns to shore.
	- He is haunted by the event for days after.
- His view of nature and humanity has changed.
