# What is The Prelude?

## Summary

The extract of The Prelude studied is centered on Wordsworthâ€™s childhood memory in the Lake District, where he steals a boat and rows it into the middle of the lake. He sees a mountain, and it is bigger than he thought it was. After realising the monumental nature of the mountain, he hurries back to the shore, claiming the experience changed his perception of nature.
