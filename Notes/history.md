## Two powers of Anglo Saxon kings:

- Raise armies to defend their country
- Make laws to govern country

## Why did Civil War break out between Charles I and Parliament

- People unhappy with Charles's ruling - believed in "divine right" from God.
    - Absolution: total control
- Personal rule from 1629-40 - arrogance
- Ship money tax only meant for war â†’ peacetime
Refused Grand Remonstrance

### Why was Labour party and unions important?

- Unions introduced workers contracts and safeties, encouraged women to advocate for rights
- 42 MPs from Labour party, pressured libs and conservatives, also reforms like national insurance and old age pensions

#### How parliament was stronger than monarchy:

##### Agree:

- Charles:

> Charles I intended to not ujse parliament, 11 years of personal rule, introduced ship money, etc. War concluded with Charles' death, and for years onwards, after restoration, monarchy still had limited power. Charles II accepted declaration of breda

- James II:

> Usurped by his own parliament, as people disagreed with his religion and hje passed pro catholic laws. Shows how parliament was more powerful, as he was removed from his position of power by parliament by essentially  inviting them.

##### Disagree:

- Elizabeth:

- Worked with MPS (Privy COuncil) to pass laws.
Parliament was her point of contact, and were allowed to raise issues about important stuff.
- William Cecil brought stability and order to court, such as having mary queen of scot executed.

- Henry VIII:

- Had to rule with nobles, but kept their power checked. in 1504, he restrained number of retainers nobleman could have.
- Henry led wars against france with heavy taxation approved by parliament
